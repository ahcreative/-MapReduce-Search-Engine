Skipping line: treemap of the popular vote by county 2016 presidential election.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: alabama has 67 counties. each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission. it also has limited executive authority in the county. because of the constraints of the alabama constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties (jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa) in the state have limited home rule. instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning. the cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems and the state legislators being buried in local county issues.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the 1973 alabama constitutional commission. legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. united states supreme court decisions in ''baker v. carr'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census in order to implement the principle of ""one man one vote"". before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties. the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the 20th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: ""the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city. a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.""

Skipping line: alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. twenty-five of the 67 counties are ""dry counties"" which ban the sale of alcohol and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.

Skipping line: kay ivey governor since april 10 2017

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: during reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope. in 1874 the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the african-american vote through violence fraud and intimidation.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: after 1890 a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. provisions which disenfranchised african americans resulted in excluding many poor whites. by 1941 more whites than african americans had been disenfranchised: 600000 to 520000. the total effects were greater on the african-american community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: from 1901 through the 1960s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. as counties were the basis of election districts the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement when whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. governor george wallace the state's only four-term governor was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. only after passage of the federal civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights. in many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in 2007 the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing ""profound regret"" over slavery and its lingering impact. in a symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol which housed congress of the confederate states of america.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in 2010 republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years after a nearly complete realignment of political parties who represent different visions in the 21st century.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: ====state elections====

Skipping line: with the disfranchisement of african americans in 1901 the state became part of the ""solid south"" a system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state. for nearly 100 years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election. since the mid to late 20th century however there has been a realignment among the two major political parties and white conservatives started shifting to the republican party. in alabama majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: members of the nine seats on the alabama supreme court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. until 1994 no republicans held any of the court seats. in that general election the then-incumbent chief justice of alabama ernest c. hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3000 votes to republican perry o. hooper sr.. hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. this ultimately led to a collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 2011 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in the early 21st century republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education. in 2010 republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. the last remaining statewide democrat who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in 2012.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: only two republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction when republicans generally represented reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. the two gop lt. governors were steve windom (1999–2003) and the current lt. governor kay ivey who was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: ====local elections====

Skipping line: many local offices (county commissioners boards of education tax assessors tax collectors etc.) in the state are still held by democrats. many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary. similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary although there are exceptions.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan at-large races and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. the current split is 35 democrats 31 republicans and one independent fayette. however most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties.  the state of alabama has one female sheriff in morgan county alabama and ten african-american sheriffs.

Skipping line: Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the ''Iliad'' other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Alluding to these legends the term ""Achilles heel"" has come to mean a point of weakness especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution.

Skipping line: 5,"Linear B tablets attest to the personal name ''Achilleus'' in the forms ''a-ki-re-u'' and ''a-ki-re-we'' the latter being the dative of the former. The name grew more popular even becoming common soon after the seventh century BC and was also turned into the female form ?????e?a (''Achilleía'') attested in Attica in the fourth century BC (IG II² 1617) and in the form ''Achillia'' on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an ""Amazon"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of  ('''') ""distress pain sorrow grief"" and  ('''') ""people soldiers nation"" resulting in a proto-form ''*Akhí-lau?os'' ""he who has the people distressed"" or ""he whose people have distress"". The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (and frequently by Achilles himself). Achilles' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of  '''' (""glory"" usually in war). Furthermore ''laós'' has been construed by Gregory Nagy following Leonard Palmer to mean ""a corps of soldiers"" a muster. With this derivation the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Another etymology relates the name to a Proto-Indo-European compound ''*h2e?-p?ds'' ""sharp foot"" which first gave an Illyrian ''*ak^pediós'' evolving through time into ''*akhpdeós'' and then ''*akhiddeús''. The shift from ''-dd-'' to ''-ll-'' is then ascribed to the passing of the name into Greek via a Pre-Greek source. The first root part ''*h2e?-'' ""sharp pointed"" also gave Greek ??? (''ak?'' ""point silence healing"") ??µ? (''akm?'' ""point edge zenith"") and ???? (''oxús'' ""sharp pointed keen quick clever"") whereas ???? stems from the root ''*h2eg?-'' ""to be upset afraid"". The whole expression would be comparable to the Latin ''acupedius'' ""swift of foot"". Compare also the Latin word family of ''acies'' ""sharp edge or point battle line battle engagement"" ''acus'' ""needle pin bodkin"" and ''acuo'' ""to make pointed sharpen whet; to exercise; to arouse"" (whence ''acute''). Some topical epitheta of Achilles in the ''Iliad'' point to this ""swift-footedness"" namely p?d????? d??? ?????e?? (''podárkes dios Achilleús'' ""swift-footed divine Achilles"") or even more frequently p?da? ???? ?????e?? (''pódas okús Achilleús'' ""quick-footed Achilles"").

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Some researchers deem the name a loan word possibly from a Pre-Greek language. Achilles' descent from the Nereid Thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as Acheron and Achelous have led to speculations about him being an old water divinity (see below Worship). Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of ''-??-'' and ''-?-'' in epic language which may account for a palatalized phoneme /ly/ in the original language.

Skipping line: Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and of Peleus the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus the fore-thinker warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by Themis goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed Peleus.

Skipping line: There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the ''Argonautica'' (4.760) Zeus' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus was also brought up by Hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal.

Skipping line: According to the ''Achilleid'' written by Statius in the 1st century AD and to non-surviving previous sources when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx. However he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel (see Achilles' heel Achilles' tendon). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: However none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary in the ''Iliad'' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus son of Pelagon challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once one grazed Achilles' elbow ""drawing a spurt of blood"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Also in the fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle in which we can find description of the hero's death (i.e. the ''Cypria'' the ''Little Iliad'' by Lesches of Pyrrha the ''Aithiopis'' and ''Iliou persis'' by Arctinus of Miletus) there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel; in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles' death the arrow (or in many cases arrows) hit his body. Peleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur on Mount Pelion to be reared. Thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity.  Achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the Trojan war. According to Homer Achilles grew up in Phthia together with his companion Patroclus.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war Thetis (or in some versions Peleus) hid the young man at the court of Lycomedes king of Skyros. There Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters perhaps under the name ""Pyrrha"" (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes' daughter Deidamia whom in the account of Statius he rapes Achilles there fathers a son Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus after his father's possible alias). According to this story Odysseus learns from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic Achilles prepares to defend the court thus giving his identity away.

Skipping line: 5,"According to the ''Iliad'' Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships each carrying 50 Myrmidons. He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius Eudorus Peisander Phoenix and Alcimedon.

Skipping line: === Telephus ===

Skipping line: When the Greeks left for the Trojan War they accidentally stopped in Mysia ruled by King Telephus. In the resulting battle Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle who stated that ""he that wounded shall heal"". Guided by the oracle he arrived at Argos where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.

Skipping line: According to other reports in Euripides' lost play about Telephus he went to Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively Telephus held Orestes for ransom the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.

Skipping line: According to the ''Cypria'' (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' wrath) when the Achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by Achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas sacked neighbouring cities (like Pedasus and Lyrnessus where the Greeks capture the queen Briseis) and killed Tenes a son of Apollo as well as Priam's son Troilus in the sanctuary of Apollo Thymbraios. However the romance between Troilus and Chryseis described in Geoffrey Chaucer's ''Troilus and Criseyde'' and in William Shakespeare's ''Troilus and Cressida'' is a medieval invention.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In Dares Phrygius' ''Account of the Destruction of Troy'' the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe as well as in older accounts Troilus was a young Trojan prince the youngest of King Priam's and Hecuba's five legitimate sons (or according other sources another son of Apollo). Despite his youth he was one of the main Trojan war leaders a ""horse fighter"" or ""chariot fighter"" according to Homer. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo Thymbraios. Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace. In this version of the myth Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege. Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood the First Vatican Mythographer claimed Troy would have been invincible.

Skipping line: The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by Agamemnon the commander of the Achaean forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave. Her father Chryses a priest of Apollo begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents but then commands that Achilles' battle prize Briseis the daughter of Briseus be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and as he says later because he loves Briseis) with the urging of his mother Thetis Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honour.

Skipping line: As the battle turns against the Greeks thanks to the influence of Zeus Nestor declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends Odysseus and two other chieftains Ajax and Phoenix to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

Skipping line: The Trojans led by Hector subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle wearing Achilles' armour though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

Skipping line: After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus the son of Nestor Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades Hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the Shield of Achilles described in great detail in the poem.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Enraged over the death of Patroclus Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by Hera and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother Deiphobus persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting he charges at Achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses. Accepting his fate Hector begs Achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that ""my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me"". Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot.  After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honour.

Skipping line: The ''Aethiopis'' (7th century BC) and a work named ''Posthomerica'' composed by Quintus of Smyrna in the fourth century AD relate further events from the Trojan War. When Penthesilea queen of the Amazons and daughter of Ares arrives in Troy Priam hopes that she defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death later. At first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her.

When Memnon son of the Dawn Goddess Eos and king of Ethiopia slays Antilochus Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing Memnon. Consequently Eos will not let the sun rise until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Skipping line: Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad'''s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic ''Aethiopis'' which was composed after the ''Iliad'' possibly in the 7th century BC. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

Skipping line: The death of Achilles as predicted by Hector with his dying breath was brought about by Paris with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions the god Apollo guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow. All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valour owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of Patroclus and funeral games were held. He was represented in the ''Aethiopis'' as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses Polyxena. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles Paris who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow killing him.

Skipping line: In the ''Odyssey'' Agamemnon informs Achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the Hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in Hades. He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the Ocean. Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus. Paris was later killed by Philoctetes using the enormous bow of Heracles.

Skipping line: In Book 11 of Homer's ''Odyssey'' Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles who when greeted as ""blessed in life blessed in death"" responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life.

Skipping line: The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'' it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers. Despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of ''paiderasteia''. In Plato's ''Symposium'' the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover. But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Achilles' armour was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus. Furious Ajax cursed Odysseus which earned the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades. After a while when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to Neoptolemus the son of Achilles.

Skipping line: A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis Lycia a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by Alexander the Great who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear. However it was shown in the time of Pausanias in the 2nd century AD.

Skipping line: when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus. in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal; telephus consulted an oracle who stated that ""he that wounded shall heal"". guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: according to other reports in euripides' lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound. achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge. alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles' aid in healing the wound. odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore the spear must be able to heal it. pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in dares phrygius' ''account of the destruction of troy'' the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe as well as in older accounts troilus was a young trojan prince the youngest of king priam's and hecuba's five legitimate sons (or according other sources another son of apollo). despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders a ""horse fighter"" or ""chariot fighter"" according to homer. prophecies linked troilus' fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of apollo thymbraios. later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace. in this version of the myth achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege. ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible.

Skipping line: 5,"The tomb of Achilles extant throughout antiquity in Troad was venerated by Thessalians but also by Persian expeditionary forces as well as by Alexander the Great and the Roman emperor Caracalla. Achilles' cult was also to be found at other places e. g. on the island of Astypalaea in the Sporades in Sparta which had a sanctuary in Elis and in Achill's homeland Thessaly as well as in the Magna Graecia cities of Tarentum Locri and Croton accounting for an almost Panhellenic cult to the hero.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The spread and intensity of the hero's veneration among the Greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the Pontus Euxinus today's Black Sea appears to have been remarkable. An archaic cult is attested for the Milesian colony of Olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea today identified with Snake Island (Ukrainian ??????? ''Zmiinyi'' near Kiliya Ukraine). Early dedicatory inscriptions from the Greek colonies on the Black Sea (graffiti and inscribed clay disks these possibly being votive offerings from Olbia the area of Berezan Island and the Tauric Chersonese) attest the existence of a heroic cult of Achilles from the sixth century BC onwards. The cult was still thriving in the third century AD when dedicatory stelae from Olbia refer to an ''Achilles Pontárches'' (???t????? roughly ""lord of the Sea"" or ""of the Pontus Euxinus"") who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia venerated on par with Olympian gods such as the local Apollo Prostates Hermes Agoraeus or Poseidon.

Skipping line: Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD) in his ''Natural History'' mentions a ""port of the Achæi"" and an ""island of Achilles"" famous for the tomb of that ""man"" (portus Achaeorum insula Achillis tumulo eius viri clara) situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the Dnieper-Bug Estuary; furthermore at 125 Roman miles from this island he places a peninsula ""which stretches forth in the shape of a sword"" obliquely called ''Dromos Achilleos'' (???????? d??µ?? ''Achilléos drómos'' ""the Race-course of Achilles"") and considered the place of the hero's exercise or of games instituted by him. This last feature of Pliny's account is considered to be the iconic spit called today ''Tendra'' (or ''Kosa Tendra'' and ''Kosa Djarilgatch'') situated between the mouth of the Dnieper and Karkinit Bay but which is hardly 125 Roman miles (c. 185 km) away from the Dnieper-Bug estuary as Pliny states. (To the ""Race-course"" he gives a length of 80 miles c. 120 km whereas the spit measures c. 70 km today.)

Skipping line: In the following chapter of his book Pliny refers to the same island as ''Achillea'' and introduces two further names for it: ''Leuce'' or ''Macaron'' (from Greek ??s?? µa?a??? ""island of the blest""). The ""present day"" measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of ''Achillea'' or ''Leuce'' with today's Snake Island. Pliny's contemporary Pomponius Mela (c. 43 AD) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named ''Achillea'' situated between the Borysthenes and the Ister adding to the geographical confusion. Ruins of a square temple measuring 30 meters to a side possibly that dedicated to Achilles were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823 on Snake Island. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC black-glazed lekythos inscription found on the island in 1840 reads: ""Glaukos son of Poseidon dedicated me to Achilles lord of Leuke."" In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC a statue is dedicated to Achilles lord of Leuke by a citizen of Olbia while in a further dedication the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on ''Leuce'' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic ''Aethiopis'' according to which after his untimely death Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical ?e??? ??s?? (''Leúke Nêsos'' ""White Island""). Already in the fifth century BC Pindar had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a ""bright island"" (fae??? ??s?? ''phaenná nâsos'') of the Black Sea while in another of his works Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite Island of the Blest together with other heroes such as his father Peleus and Cadmus. Well known is the connection of these mythological Fortunate Isles (µa?a??? ??s?? ''makárôn nêsoi'') or the Homeric Elysium with the stream Oceanus which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it. Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by Alcaeus speaking of ""Achilles lord of Scythia"" and the opposition of North and South as evoked by Achilles' fight against the Aethiopian prince Memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother Eos after his death.

Skipping line: The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetes who lived probably during the first century AD wrote that the island was called ''Leuce'' ""because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there in Leuce island reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour"". Similarly others relate the island's name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there. Pausanias has been told that the island is ""covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame. In this island there is also Achilles' temple and his statue"". Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound. Ammianus Marcellinus attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.

Skipping line: A number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. Herodotus Pliny the Elder and Strabo reported on the existence of a town ''Achílleion'' (?????e???) built by settlers from Mytilene in the sixth century BC close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the Troad. Later attestations point to an ''Achílleion'' in Messenia (according to Stephanus Byzantinus) and an ''Achílleios'' (?????e???) in Laconia. Nicolae Densusianu recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of Aquileia and of the northern arm of the Danube delta called Chilia (presumably from an older ''Achileii'') though his conclusion that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.

Skipping line: The kings of Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son Neoptolemus. Alexander the Great son of the Epirote princess Olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor.

In AD 216 the Roman Emperor Caracalla while on his way to war against Parthia emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.

Skipping line: 5,"=== Achilles in Greek tragedy ===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy ''The Myrmidons'' focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today. In Plato's ''Symposium'' Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.

Skipping line: The tragedian Sophocles also wrote ''The Lovers of Achilles'' a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Towards the end of the 5th century BC a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; Euripides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in ''Hecuba'' ''Electra'' and ''Iphigenia in Aulis''.

Skipping line: === Achilles in Greek philosophy ===

Skipping line: The philosopher Zeno of Elea centered one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between ""swift-footed"" Achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: === Achilles in Roman and medieval literature ===

Skipping line: The Romans who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy took a highly negative view of Achilles. Virgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children. Other writers such as Catullus Propertius and Ovid represent a second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Benoît de Sainte-Maure's ''Roman de Troie'' and Guido delle Colonne's ''Historia destructionis Troiae'' which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century.

Skipping line: Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler Leo the Deacon not as Hellene but as Scythian while according to the Byzantine author John Malalas his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as Bulgars.

Skipping line: '''Abraham Lincoln''' (; February 12 1809 – April 15 1865) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War—its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral constitutional and political crisis. In doing so he preserved the Union paved the way to abolition of slavery strengthened the federal government and modernized the economy.

Skipping line: Born in Hodgenville Kentucky Lincoln grew up on the western frontier in Kentucky and Indiana. Largely self-educated he became a lawyer in Illinois a Whig Party leader and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in which he served for eight years. Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks tariffs and railroads. Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress and because his opposition to the Mexican–American War was unpopular among Illinois voters Lincoln returned to Springfield and resumed his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854 he became a leader in building the new Republican Party which had a statewide majority in Illinois. In 1858 while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival Democrat Stephen A. Douglas Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery but lost the U.S. Senate race to Douglas. In 1860 Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state by being the second choice of a grand majority of convention delegates whose first choices due to factionalism could not garner enough votes to win. Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South he swept the North and was elected president in 1860.

Skipping line: Lincoln's victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House—no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession. Subsequently on April 12 1861 a Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the Union. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats who called for more compromise; anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads) who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists who plotted his assassination.

Skipping line: Politically Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other by carefully planned political patronage and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory. His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism republicanism equal rights liberty and democracy. Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war. His primary goal was to reunite the nation. He suspended habeas corpus leading to the controversial ''ex parte Merryman'' decision and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the ''Trent'' Affair in late 1861. 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln closely supervised the war effort especially the selection of top generals including his most successful general Ulysses S. Grant. He also made major decisions on Union war strategy including a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system. Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond; each time a general failed Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded. As the war progressed his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which permanently outlawed slavery.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election. Anticipating the war's conclusion Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. On April 14 1865 five days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth and died the next day. Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Skipping line: 6,"===Early life and ancestry===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Abraham Lincoln was born February 12 1809 the second child of Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln in a one-room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville Kentucky. He was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln an Englishman who migrated from Hingham Norfolk to its namesake of Hingham Massachusetts in 1638. Samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's western migration which passed through New Jersey Pennsylvania and Virginia. Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake Captain Abraham Lincoln moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County Kentucky in the 1780s. Captain Lincoln was killed in an Indian raid in 1786. His children including eight-year-old Thomas the future president's father witnessed the attack. After his father's murder Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier working at odd jobs in Kentucky and in Tennessee before settling with members of his family in Hardin County Kentucky in the early 1800s.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln's mother Nancy is widely assumed to have been the daughter of Lucy Hanks although no record of Nancy Hanks' birth has ever been found. According to William Ensign Lincoln's book ''The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln'' Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks; however the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock. Still another researcher Adin Baber claims that Nancy Hanks was the daughter of Abraham Hanks and Sarah Harper of Virginia.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were married on June 12 1806 in Washington County and moved to Elizabethtown Kentucky following their marriage. They became the parents of three children: Sarah born on February 10 1807; Abraham on February 12 1809; and another son Thomas who died in infancy. Thomas Lincoln bought or leased several farms in Kentucky including the Sinking Spring farm where Abraham was born; however a land title dispute soon forced the Lincolns to move. In 1811 the family moved eight miles (13 km) north to Knob Creek Farm where Thomas acquired title to  of land. In 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm. Of the 816.5 acres (330 ha) that Thomas held in Kentucky he lost all but  of his land in court disputes over property titles. Frustrated over the lack of security provided by the Kentucky title survey system in the courts Thomas sold the remaining land he held in Kentucky in 1814 and began planning a move to Indiana where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In 1816 the family moved north across the Ohio River to Indiana a free non-slaveholding territory where they settled in an ""unbroken forest"" in Hurricane Township Perry County. (Their land in southern Indiana became part of Spencer County Indiana when the county was established in 1818.) The farm is preserved as part of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial. In 1860 Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was ""partly on account of slavery""; but mainly due to land title difficulties in Kentucky. During the family's years in Kentucky and Indiana Thomas Lincoln worked as a farmer cabinetmaker and carpenter. He owned farms several town lots and livestock paid taxes sat on juries appraised estates served on country slave patrols and guarded prisoners. Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were also members of a Separate Baptists church which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol dancing and slavery. Within a year of the family's arrival in Indiana Thomas claimed title to  of Indiana land. Despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to  of land in what became known as the Little Pigeon Creek Community in Spencer County. Prior to the family's move to Illinois in 1830 Thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Several significant family events took place during Lincoln's youth in Indiana. On October 5 1818 Nancy Lincoln died of milk sickness leaving eleven-year-old Sarah in charge of a household that included her father nine-year-old Abraham and Dennis Hanks Nancy's nineteen-year-old orphaned cousin. On December 2 1819 Lincoln's father married Sarah ""Sally"" Bush Johnston a widow from Elizabethtown Kentucky with three children of her own. Abraham became very close to his stepmother whom he referred to as ""Mother"". Those who knew Lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister Sarah's death on January 20 1828 while giving birth to a stillborn son.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: As a youth Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his ""reading scribbling writing ciphering writing Poetry etc."" and must have done it to avoid manual labor. His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy ""physical labor"" but loved to read. Lincoln was largely self-educated. His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year; however he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning. Family neighbors and schoolmates of Lincoln's youth recalled that he read and reread the ''King James Bible'' ''Aesop's Fables'' Bunyan's ''The Pilgrim's Progress'' Defoe's ''Robinson Crusoe'' Weems's ''The Life of Washington'' and Franklin's ''Autobiography'' among others.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: As he grew into his teens Lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household. He also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twenty-one. Abraham became adept at using an axe. Tall for his age Lincoln was also strong and athletic. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as ""the Clary's Grove boys"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In early March 1830 partly out of fear of a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River several members of the extended Lincoln family moved west to Illinois a non-slaveholding state and settled in Macon County  west of Decatur. Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to leave Indiana and one possibility is that other members of the family including Dennis Hanks might not have attained the stability and steady income that Thomas Lincoln had. After the family relocated to Illinois Abraham became increasingly distant from his father in part because of his father's lack of education and occasionally lent him money. In 1831 as Thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a new homestead in Coles County Illinois Abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own. Traveling down the Sangamon River he ended up in the village of New Salem in Sangamon County. Later that spring Denton Offutt a New Salem merchant hired Lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon Illinois and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—Lincoln returned to New Salem where he remained for the next six years.

Skipping line: According to some sources Lincoln's first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; these sources indicate that by 1835 they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died at the age of 22 on August 25 1835 most likely of typhoid fever. In the early 1830s he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Late in 1836 Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836 and Lincoln courted her for a time; however they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16 1837 Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In 1840 Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in Lexington Kentucky. They met in Springfield Illinois in December 1839 and were engaged the following December.

Skipping line: A wedding set for January 1 1841 was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative. They later met again at a party and married on November 4 1842 in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister. While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again Lincoln when asked where he was going replied ""To hell I suppose."" In 1844 the couple bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: He was an affectionate though often absent husband and father of four children. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in 1843 and Edward Baker Lincoln (Eddie) in 1846. Edward died on February 1 1850 in Springfield probably of tuberculosis. ""Willie"" Lincoln was born on December 21 1850 and died of a fever on February 20 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son Thomas ""Tad"" Lincoln was born on April 4 1853 and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16 1871. Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children. The Lincolns' last descendant great-grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith died in 1985. Lincoln ""was remarkably fond of children"" and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Later in life Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875. Abraham Lincoln suffered from ""melancholy"" a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln's father-in-law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington.

Skipping line: In 1832 at age 23 Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in New Salem Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem though he lacked an education powerful friends and money which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.

Skipping line: Before the election Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War. Following his return Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly. At  he was tall and ""strong enough to intimidate any rival"". At his first speech when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his ""neck and the seat of his trousers"" and threw him. Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected) though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor all the while reading voraciously. He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone's ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'' and other law books. Of his learning method Lincoln stated: ""I studied with nobody"". His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a Whig many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.

Skipping line: Admitted to the Illinois bar in 1836 he moved to Springfield Illinois and began to practice law under John T. Stuart Mary Todd's cousin. Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with Stephen T. Logan from 1841 until 1844. Then Lincoln began his practice with William Herndon whom Lincoln thought ""a studious young man"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Successful on his second run for office Lincoln served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County. He supported the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal which he remained involved with later as a Canal Commissioner. In the 1835–36 legislative session he voted to expand suffrage to white males whether landowners or not. He was known for his ""free soil"" stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism. He first articulated this in 1837 saying ""The Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils."" His stance closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa.

Skipping line: From the early 1830s Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be ""an old line Whig a disciple of Henry Clay"". The party including Lincoln favored economic modernization in banking protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads and espoused urbanization as well.

Skipping line: Lincoln ran for the Whig nomination for Illinois's 7th district of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1843 but was defeated by John J. Hardin. However Lincoln won support for the principle of rotation whereby Hardin would retire after only one term to allow for the nomination of another candidate. Lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846. Lincoln was indeed elected to the House of Representatives in 1846 where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. Lincoln in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners enforcement to capture fugitive slaves and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.

Skipping line: On foreign and military policy Lincoln spoke out against the Mexican–American War which he attributed to President Polk's desire for ""military glory—that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood"". Lincoln also supported the Wilmot Proviso which if it had been adopted would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.

Skipping line: Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S. Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had ""invaded ''our territory'' and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our ''own soil''. Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.

Skipping line: Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it the national papers ignored it and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district.

Skipping line: Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency Lincoln who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election. Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival Justin Butterfield considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer but in Lincoln's view an ""old fossil"". The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory. This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice.

Skipping line: 6,"Lincoln in 1857

Skipping line: Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield handling ""every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer"". Twice a year for 16 years 10 weeks at a time he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man Lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him. In fact he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. In 1849 he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.

Skipping line: In 1851 he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders James A. Barret who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route. Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer superior and less expensive route and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the Illinois Supreme Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation. Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases in 51 as sole counsel of which 31 were decided in his favor. From 1853 to 1860 another of Lincoln's largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad. Lincoln's reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname ""Honest Abe.""

Skipping line: Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended William ""Duff"" Armstrong who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight Lincoln produced a ''Farmers' Almanac'' showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence Armstrong was acquitted.

Skipping line: Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case where he defended a cousin Peachy Harrison who was accused of stabbing another to death Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client.

Skipping line: lincoln returned to practicing law in springfield handling ""every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer"". twice a year for 16 years 10 weeks at a time he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. as a riverboat man lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him. in fact he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. in 1849 he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. the idea was never commercialized but lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.

Skipping line: in 1851 he represented the alton & sangamon railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders james a. barret who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route. lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer superior and less expensive route and the corporation retained the right to demand barret's payment. the decision by the illinois supreme court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation. lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases in 51 as sole counsel of which 31 were decided in his favor. from 1853 to 1860 another of lincoln's largest clients was the illinois central railroad. lincoln's reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname ""honest abe.""

Skipping line: lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended william ""duff"" armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker. the case is famous for lincoln's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. after an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a ''farmers' almanac'' showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility. based on this evidence armstrong was acquitted.

Skipping line: ===Emergence as Republican leader===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave-holding South and the North and the Compromise of 1850 failed to defuse the issue. In the early 1850s Lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation and his 1852 eulogy for Henry Clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to ""both extremes"" on the slavery issue. As the 1850s progressed the debate over slavery in the Nebraska Territory and Kansas Territory became particularly acrimonious and Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise measure; the proposal would take the issue of slavery out of the hands of Congress by allowing the people of each territory to decide the status of slavery themselves. The proposal alarmed many Northerners who hoped to stop the spread of slavery into the territories. Despite this Northern opposition Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: For months after its passage Lincoln did not publicly comment on the Kansas-Nebraska Act but he came to strongly oppose it. On October 16 1854 in his ""Peoria Speech"" Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency. Speaking in his Kentucky accent with a very powerful voice he said the Kansas Act had a ""''declared'' indifference but as I must think a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ..."" Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas-Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Nationally the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting the demise of his party Lincoln would write in 1855 ""I think I am a Whig but others say there are no Whigs and that I am an abolitionist ... I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.""  Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party and combining Free Soil Liberty and antislavery Democratic Party members the new Republican Party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery. Lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists. Lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing Whig Party though he bemoaned his party's growing closeness with the nativist Know Nothing movement.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature as Whig.  In the aftermath of the 1854 elections which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the Kansas-Nebraska Act Lincoln declined to take his seat and instead sought election to the United States Senate. At that time senators were elected by the state legislature. After leading in the first six rounds of voting but unable to obtain a majority Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters also antislavery Democrats had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate Joel Aldrich Matteson.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In part due to the ongoing violent political confrontations in the Kansas opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act remained strong in Illinois and throughout the North. As the 1856 elections approached Lincoln abandoned the defunct Whig Party in favor of the Republicans. He attended the May 1856 Bloomington Convention which formally established the Illinois Republican Party. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union. At the June 1856 Republican National Convention Lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot though the party nominated a ticket of John C. Frémont and William Dayton. Lincoln strongly supported the Republican ticket campaigning for the party throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Ambassador James Buchanan who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories while the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore. In the 1856 elections Buchanan defeated both his challengers but Frémont won several Northern states and Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois. Though Lincoln did not himself win office his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading Republican in Illinois.

Skipping line: Eric Foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.

Skipping line: A portrait of Dred Scott. Lincoln denounced the Supreme Court decision in ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' as part of a conspiracy to extend slavery.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In March 1857 the Supreme Court issued its decision in ''Dred Scott v. Sandford''; Chief Justice Roger B. Taney opined that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution. While many Democrats hoped that ''Dred Scott'' would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the North. Lincoln denounced the decision alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power. Lincoln argued ""The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color size intellect moral developments or social capacity' but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness'.""

Skipping line: ===Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: his debates with Stephen Douglas over slavery

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Douglas was up for re-election in 1858 and Lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful Illinois Democrat. With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican Senator many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858 and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party. Some eastern Republicans favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. But many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate and Lincoln won the party's Senate nomination with little opposition.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Accepting the nomination Lincoln delivered his House Divided Speech drawing on  ""A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other."" The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied Republicans across the North. The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would in turn select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator. On being informed of Lincoln's nomination Douglas stated ""Lincoln is the strong man of the party...and if I beat him my victory will be hardly won.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The Senate campaign featured the seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858 the most famous political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that ""The Slave Power"" was threatening the values of republicanism and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the ''Dred Scott'' decision.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the Democrats won more seats and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859 Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger'' a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize. In the aftermath of the 1858 election newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 1860 with William H. Seward Salmon P. Chase Edward Bates and Simon Cameron looming as rivals for the nomination. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest he lacked support in the Northeast and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency. In January 1860 Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered and in the following months several local papers endorsed Lincoln for president.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: On February 27 1860 New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery and rejected any ""groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong"". Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly—Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist Noah Brooks reported ""No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Historian Donald described the speech as a ""superb political move for an unannounced candidate to appear in one rival's (Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (Chase) loyalists while not mentioning either by name during its delivery"". In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions Lincoln said ""The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little.""

Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis Norman Judd Leonard Swett and Jesse DuBois and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency. Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father (clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax) Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of ""The Rail Candidate"". In 1860 Lincoln described himself : ""I am in height six feet four inches nearly; lean in flesh weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion with coarse black hair and gray eyes."" A biographer added that he had a: 

Skipping line: :Large head with high crown of skull; thick bushy hair; large and deep eye-caverns; heavy eyebrows; a large nose; large ears; large mouth; thin upper and somewhat thick under lip; very high and prominent cheek-bones; cheeks thin and sunken; strongly developed jawbone; chin slightly upturned; a thin but sinewy neck rather long; long arms; large hands; chest thin and narrow as compared with his great height; legs of more than proportionate length and large feet.

Skipping line: On May 18 at the Republican National Convention in Chicago Lincoln's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat Hannibal Hamlin of Maine was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.

Skipping line: On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top. Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs. Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others while following Lincoln's strong dictate to ""Make no contracts that bind me"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the ''Dred Scott'' decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. Meanwhile Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the Democratic convention disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty and ultimately selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate. A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas would compete for votes in the North

Skipping line: while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Prior to the Republican convention the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide teen and young adult organization the Wide Awakes which it used to generate popular support for Lincoln  throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties. As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew so did his supporters. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform and second on Lincoln's life story emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of ""free labor"" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life and sold 100000 to 200000 copies.

Skipping line: ===emergence as republican leader===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave-holding south and the north and the compromise of 1850 failed to defuse the issue. in the early 1850s lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation and his 1852 eulogy for henry clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to ""both extremes"" on the slavery issue. as the 1850s progressed the debate over slavery in the nebraska territory and kansas territory became particularly acrimonious and senator stephen a. douglas of illinois proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise measure; the proposal would take the issue of slavery out of the hands of congress by allowing the people of each territory to decide the status of slavery themselves. the proposal alarmed many northerners who hoped to stop the spread of slavery into the territories. despite this northern opposition douglas's kansas-nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may 1854.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: for months after its passage lincoln did not publicly comment on the kansas-nebraska act but he came to strongly oppose it. on october 16 1854 in his ""peoria speech"" lincoln declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency. speaking in his kentucky accent with a very powerful voice he said the kansas act had a ""''declared'' indifference but as i must think a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. i cannot but hate it. i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ..."" lincoln's attacks on the kansas-nebraska act marked his return to political life.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: nationally the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas–nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. reflecting the demise of his party lincoln would write in 1855 ""i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist ... i do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.""  drawing on the antislavery portion of the whig party and combining free soil liberty and antislavery democratic party members the new republican party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery. lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists. lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing whig party though he bemoaned his party's growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature as whig.  in the aftermath of the 1854 elections which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the kansas-nebraska act lincoln declined to take his seat and instead sought election to the united states senate. at that time senators were elected by the state legislature. after leading in the first six rounds of voting but unable to obtain a majority lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull. trumbull was an antislavery democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters also antislavery democrats had vowed not to support any whig. lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull's antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate joel aldrich matteson.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in part due to the ongoing violent political confrontations in the kansas opposition to the kansas-nebraska act remained strong in illinois and throughout the north. as the 1856 elections approached lincoln abandoned the defunct whig party in favor of the republicans. he attended the may 1856 bloomington convention which formally established the illinois republican party. the convention platform asserted that congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of kansas as a free state. lincoln gave the final speech of the convention in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the union. at the june 1856 republican national convention lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot though the party nominated a ticket of john c. frémont and william dayton. lincoln strongly supported the republican ticket campaigning for the party throughout illinois. the democrats nominated former ambassador james buchanan who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories while the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore. in the 1856 elections buchanan defeated both his challengers but frémont won several northern states and republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois. though lincoln did not himself win office his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading republican in illinois.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: eric foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery radical republicans of the northeast who saw slavery as a sin with the conservative republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. foner argues that lincoln was a moderate in the middle opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the founding fathers especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the declaration of independence.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in march 1857 the supreme court issued its decision in ''dred scott v. sandford''; chief justice roger b. taney opined that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution. while many democrats hoped that ''dred scott'' would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the north. lincoln denounced the decision alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power. lincoln argued ""the authors of the declaration of independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color size intellect moral developments or social capacity' but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness'.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: his debates with stephen douglas over slavery

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: douglas was up for re-election in 1858 and lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful illinois democrat. with the former democrat trumbull now serving as a republican senator many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in 1858 and lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party. some eastern republicans favored the reelection of douglas for the senate in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. but many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference. for the first time illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate and lincoln won the party's senate nomination with little opposition.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: accepting the nomination lincoln delivered his house divided speech drawing on  ""a house divided against itself cannot stand. i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved—i do not expect the house to fall—but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing or all the other."" the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north. the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas as its u.s. senator. on being informed of lincoln's nomination douglas stated ""lincoln is the strong man of the party...and if i beat him my victory will be hardly won.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the senate campaign featured the seven lincoln–douglas debates of 1858 the most famous political debates in american history. the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. lincoln warned that ""the slave power"" was threatening the values of republicanism and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that all men are created equal while douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. lincoln stated douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. douglas said that lincoln was defying the authority of the u.s. supreme court and the ''dred scott'' decision.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature re-elected douglas to the senate. despite the bitterness of the defeat for lincoln his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. in may 1859 lincoln purchased the ''illinois staats-anzeiger'' a german-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130000 german americans voted democratic but there was republican support that a german-language paper could mobilize. in the aftermath of the 1858 election newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate in 1860 with william h. seward salmon p. chase edward bates and simon cameron looming as rivals for the nomination. while lincoln was popular in the midwest he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency. in january 1860 lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered and in the following months several local papers endorsed lincoln for president.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: on february 27 1860 new york party leaders invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union to a group of powerful republicans. lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the republicans required opposition to slavery and rejected any ""groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong"". despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly—lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the republican presidential nomination. journalist noah brooks reported ""no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: historian donald described the speech as a ""superb political move for an unannounced candidate to appear in one rival's (seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (chase) loyalists while not mentioning either by name during its delivery"". in response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions lincoln said ""the taste ''is'' in my mouth a little.""

Skipping line: ===1860 election and secession===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: On November 6 1860 Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States beating Douglas Breckinridge and Bell. He was the first president from the Republican Party. His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln received 1866452 votes Douglas 1376957 votes Breckinridge 849781 votes and Bell 588789 votes. Turnout was 82.2 percent with Lincoln winning the free Northern states as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri and split New Jersey with Lincoln. Bell won Virginia Tennessee and Kentucky and Breckinridge won the rest of the South.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote his victory in the electoral college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York New Jersey and Rhode Island but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The first photographic image of the new president

Skipping line: As Lincoln's election became evident secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March. On December 20 1860 South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1 1861 Florida Mississippi Alabama Georgia Louisiana and Texas followed. Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the Confederate States of America. The upper South and border states (Delaware Maryland Virginia North Carolina Tennessee Kentucky Missouri and Arkansas) listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy declaring secession illegal. The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9 1861.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: There were attempts at compromise. The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820 dividing the territories into slave and free contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform. Lincoln rejected the idea saying ""I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln however did tacitly support the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent. A few weeks before the war Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.

Skipping line: En route to his inauguration by train Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. The president-elect then evaded possible assassins in Baltimore who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security Allan Pinkerton. On February 23 1861 he arrived in disguise in Washington D.C. which was placed under substantial military guard. Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South proclaiming once again that he had no intention or inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states:

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: ""We are not enemies but friends. We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature."" The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861 no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. Lincoln said as the war was ending:

Skipping line: :Both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came.

Skipping line: Major Anderson Ft. Sumter commander

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The commander of Fort Sumter South Carolina Major Robert Anderson sent a request for provisions to Washington and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12 1861 Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter forcing them to surrender and began the war. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was ""sadly disappointed"" at his failure to realize that ""the country was sleeping on a volcano"" and that the South was preparing for war. Historian Donald concludes that ""His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.""

Skipping line: On April 15 Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect Washington and ""preserve the Union"" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital despite the exposed position of Richmond so close to Union lines. North Carolina Tennessee and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral. The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the Mason-Dixon line to the defense of the American nation. Historian Allan Nevins says: 

Skipping line: :The thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment ... Anger swept the land. From every side came news of mass meetings speeches resolutions tenders of business support the muster of companies and regiments the determined action of governors and legislatures.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: States sent Union regiments south in response to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19 mobs in Baltimore which controlled the rail links attacked Union troops who were changing trains and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of ''habeas corpus'' in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington. John Merryman a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander Roger B. Taney author of the controversial pro-slavery ''Dred Scott'' opinion to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus'' and in June Taney acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court issued the writ because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling.

Skipping line: ===War strategy===

Skipping line: After the Battle of Fort Sumter Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commander-in-chief using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress and after suspending ''habeas corpus'' arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.

Skipping line: The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln and dominated his time and attention. From the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6 1861 Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In late August 1861 General John C. Frémont the 1856 Republican presidential nominee issued without consulting his superiors in Washington a proclamation of martial law in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. After Lincoln acted Union enlistments from Maryland Kentucky and Missouri increased by over 40000 troops.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State William Seward. At times Seward was too bellicose so for balance Lincoln stuck a close working relationship with Senator Charles Sumner the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship the ''Trent'' on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer James G. Randall has dissected Lincoln's successful techniques:

Skipping line: :his restraint his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence his early softening of State Department's attitude toward Britain his deference toward Seward and Sumner his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion his readiness to arbitrate his golden silence in addressing Congress his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America's true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the War Department headquarters.  He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort consulted with governors and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862 after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department Lincoln replaced Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton as War Secretary. Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction. Nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. ""Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together"" say Thomas and Hyman.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In terms of war strategy Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck a disciple of the European strategist Jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army rather than simply capturing territory.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: ===General McClellan===

Skipping line: After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861 Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McClellan a young West Point graduate railroad executive and Pennsylvania Democrat took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: George McClellan after the Battle of Antietam in 1862

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief in March 1862 after McClellan's ""Harrison's Landing Letter"" in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. The office remained empty until July when Henry Halleck was selected for it. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope a Republican as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: However lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan now commanding the Army of the Potomac Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862 forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS ''Virginia'' formerly the USS ''Merrimack'' damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk Virginia before being engaged and damaged by the USS ''Monitor''. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope Lincoln was desperate and restored him to command of all forces around Washington to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: battle of May 3 1863

Skipping line: Burnside against the advice of the president prematurely launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The mid-term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war as well as rising inflation new high taxes rumors of corruption the suspension of ''habeas corpus'' the military draft law and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: While Republicans were discouraged Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania Ohio Indiana and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states except New York. The Cincinnati ''Gazette'' contended that the voters were ""depressed by the interminable nature of this war as so far conducted and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In the spring of 1863 Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond Rosecrans' on Chattanooga Grant's on Vicksburg and a naval assault on Charleston.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper's Ferry and tendered his resignation which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign which was a victory for the Union though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time after initial setbacks Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.

Skipping line: After the Battle of Gettysburg Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution which before 1865 committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it as envisioned by the Founding Fathers under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862 on the grounds that it was not within their power and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: On June 19 1862 endorsed by Lincoln Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July the Confiscation Act of 1862 was passed which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it he stated that ""as a fit and necessary military measure on January 1 1863 all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward and forever be free"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Privately Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential ''New York Tribune'' fell for the ploy and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22 1862. Although he said he personally wished all men could be free Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the U.S. president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his ""official duty"") was that of preserving the Union:

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The Emancipation Proclamation issued on September 22 1862 and put into effect on January 1 1863 declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective as Union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: ""I never in my life felt more certain that I was doing right than I do in signing this paper."" For some time Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. By the spring of 1863 Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Andrew Johnson the military governor of Tennessee encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops Lincoln wrote ""The bare sight of 50000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once"". By the end of 1863 at Lincoln's direction General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley. Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln: ""In his company I was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the speech

Skipping line: With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort despite the New York City draft riots. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19 1863. Defying Lincoln's prediction that ""the world will little note nor long remember what we say here"" the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In 272 words and three minutes Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789 but in 1776 ""conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal"". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as a result of the losses and the future of democracy in the world would be assured that ""government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth"". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General Ulysses S. Grant's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh Lincoln had said ""I can't spare this man. He fights."" With Grant in command Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Nevertheless Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864 as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions and being assured that he had none submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General which no officer had held since George Washington.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864. This is often characterized as a war of attrition given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive the Confederate forces had ""almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces"". The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were to which the general replied ""I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The Confederacy lacked reinforcements so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south crossed the James River forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg Virginia. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North and replaced the Union losses.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations railroads and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a  swath but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. Mark E. Neely Jr. has argued that there was no effort to engage in ""total war"" against civilians which he believed did take place during World War II.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Confederate general Jubal Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's raid on Washington D.C. in 1864 Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him ""Get down you damn fool before you get shot!"" After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln Seward and others at Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1 1865 Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later when that city fell Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city white Southerners were stone-faced but freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9 Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: While the war was still being waged Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together build support for his own policies and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention the Republican Party selected Johnson a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:

Skipping line:  Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: While the Democratic platform followed the ""Peace wing"" of the party and called the war a ""failure"" their candidate General George B. McClellan supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut's capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads. On November 8 Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide carrying all but three states and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.

Skipping line: On March 4 1865 Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address. In it he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will.

Skipping line: ===Reconstruction===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated and Lincoln replied ""Let 'em up easy."" In keeping with that sentiment Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radical Republicans under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office had not mistreated Union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: As Southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors respectively. In Louisiana Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the Wade-Davis Bill in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana Arkansas and Tennessee.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court he named the choice of the Radicals Salmon P. Chase who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation which did not apply to every state Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would ""clinch the whole matter"". By December 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15 1864 in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House a second attempt passed Congress on January 31 1865 and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. Upon ratification it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6 1865.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: As the war drew to a close Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen. Lincoln biographers James G. Randall and Richard Current according to David Lincove argue that:

Skipping line: :It is likely that had he lived Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Eric Foner argues that:

Skipping line: :Unlike Sumner and other Radicals Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed as most Republicans did in April 1865 that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists reluctant secessionists and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war Lincoln after initial opposition had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans. ... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves ... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.""

Skipping line: ===Redefining the republic and republicanism===

Skipping line: Lincoln in February 1865 about two months before his death

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term ""the United States"" has historically been used sometimes in the plural (""these United States"") and other times in the singular without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In recent years historians such as Harry Jaffa Herman Belz John Diggins Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of ''republican values''. As early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the ""sheet anchor"" of republicanism. The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860 ""Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."" His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. Nevertheless in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree) and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In March 1861 in Lincoln's first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said ""A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: ===Other enactments===

Skipping line: Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the Homestead Act in 1862 making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.

Skipping line: Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent) and a new Federal income tax. In 1861 Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861 Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861 creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms) which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862 Congress created with Lincoln's approval the Department of Agriculture. In 1862 Lincoln sent a senior general John Pope to put down the ""Sioux Uprising"" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved). President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.

Skipping line: In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one however the editors of the ''New York World'' and the ''Journal of Commerce'' published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.

Skipping line: Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. Before Lincoln's presidency Thanksgiving while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during James Madison's presidency 50 years before. In 1863 Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. In June 1864 Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Salmon Portland Chase was Lincoln's choice to be Chief Justice of the United States.

Skipping line: Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that ""we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known."" Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. Noah Haynes Swayne nominated January 21 1862 and appointed January 24 1862 was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. Samuel Freeman Miller nominated and appointed on July 16 1862 supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 nominated December 1 1862 and appointed December 8 1862 had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. Stephen Johnson Field a previous California Supreme Court justice was nominated March 6 1863 and appointed March 10 1863 and provided geographic balance as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally Lincoln's Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase was nominated as Chief Justice and appointed the same day on December 6 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist would support Reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the Republican Party.

Skipping line: ====Other judicial appointments====

Skipping line: Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States and 27 judges to the United States district courts. Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts during his time in office.

As a condition for its admission West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery. Nevada which became the third State in the far-west of the continent was admitted as a free state on October 31 1864.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected the 16th president of the united states beating douglas breckinridge and bell. he was the first president from the republican party. his victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the north and west; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 southern slave states and he won only two of 996 counties in all the southern states.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln received 1866452 votes douglas 1376957 votes breckinridge 849781 votes and bell 588789 votes. turnout was 82.2 percent with lincoln winning the free northern states as well as california and oregon. douglas won missouri and split new jersey with lincoln. bell won virginia tennessee and kentucky and breckinridge won the rest of the south.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: although lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote his victory in the electoral college was decisive: lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. there were fusion tickets in which all of lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of electors in new york new jersey and rhode island but even if the anti-lincoln vote had been combined in every state lincoln still would have won a majority in the electoral college.

Skipping line: the first photographic image of the new president

Skipping line: as lincoln's election became evident secessionists made clear their intent to leave the union before he took office the next march. on december 20 1860 south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by february 1 1861 florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas followed. six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the confederate states of america. the upper south and border states (delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas) listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal. president buchanan and president-elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal. the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february 9 1861.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: there were attempts at compromise. the crittenden compromise would have extended the missouri compromise line of 1820 dividing the territories into slave and free contrary to the republican party's free-soil platform. lincoln rejected the idea saying ""i will suffer death before i consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln however did tacitly support the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress before lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. that proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that congress would not interfere with slavery without southern consent. a few weeks before the war lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution. lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the constitution.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: en route to his inauguration by train lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north. the president-elect then evaded possible assassins in baltimore who were uncovered by lincoln's head of security allan pinkerton. on february 23 1861 he arrived in disguise in washington d.c. which was placed under substantial military guard. lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no intention or inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states:

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south: ""we are not enemies but friends. we must not be enemies ... the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature."" the failure of the peace conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. by march 1861 no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms. meanwhile lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated. lincoln said as the war was ending:

Skipping line: :both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: major anderson ft. sumter commander

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the commander of fort sumter south carolina major robert anderson sent a request for provisions to washington and the execution of lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. on april 12 1861 confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter forcing them to surrender and began the war. historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was ""sadly disappointed"" at his failure to realize that ""the country was sleeping on a volcano"" and that the south was preparing for war. historian donald concludes that ""his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft. sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. but he also vowed not to surrender the forts. the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: on april 15 lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect washington and ""preserve the union"" which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. this call forced the states to choose sides. virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the confederate capital despite the exposed position of richmond so close to union lines. north carolina tennessee and arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail; kentucky tried to be neutral. the confederate attack on fort sumter rallied americans north of the mason-dixon line to the defense of the american nation. historian allan nevins says: 

Skipping line: :the thunderclap of sumter produced a startling crystallization of northern sentiment ... anger swept the land. from every side came news of mass meetings speeches resolutions tenders of business support the muster of companies and regiments the determined action of governors and legislatures.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: states sent union regiments south in response to lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. on april 19 mobs in baltimore which controlled the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. the army responded by arresting local maryland officials. lincoln suspended the writ of ''habeas corpus'' in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach washington. john merryman a maryland official involved in hindering the u.s. troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice and marylander roger b. taney author of the controversial pro-slavery ''dred scott'' opinion to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus'' and in june taney acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the supreme court issued the writ because in his opinion only congress could suspend the writ. lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the ex parte merryman ruling.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: ===war strategy===

Skipping line: after the battle of fort sumter lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commander-in-chief using unprecedented powers. he expanded his war powers and imposed a blockade on all the confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress and after suspending ''habeas corpus'' arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers. lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions. in addition lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.

Skipping line: ''running the 'machine'' : an 1864 political cartoon satirizing lincoln's administration—featuring william fessenden edwin stanton william seward gideon welles lincoln and others.

Skipping line: the war effort was the source of continued disparagement of lincoln and dominated his time and attention. from the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions in the union army. copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. conversely the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. on august 6 1861 lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederate war effort. in practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the confederacy.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in late august 1861 general john c. frémont the 1856 republican presidential nominee issued without consulting his superiors in washington a proclamation of martial law in missouri. he declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the department of the west compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. lincoln overruled frémont's proclamation. lincoln believed that fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. after lincoln acted union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over 40000 troops.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his secretary of state william seward. at times seward was too bellicose so for balance lincoln stuck a close working relationship with senator charles sumner the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee. the trent affair of late 1861 threatened war with great britain. the u.s. navy had illegally intercepted a british mail ship the ''trent'' on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys; britain protested vehemently while the u.s. cheered. lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. biographer james g. randall has dissected lincoln's successful techniques:

Skipping line: :his restraint his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence his early softening of state department's attitude toward britain his deference toward seward and sumner his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion his readiness to arbitrate his golden silence in addressing congress his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for america's true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the war department headquarters.  he kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort consulted with governors and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). in january 1862 after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced simon cameron with edwin stanton as war secretary. stanton was a staunchly unionist pro-business conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction. nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official. ""stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together"" say thomas and hyman.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in terms of war strategy lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that washington was well-defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the north for prompt decisive victory; major northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. twice a week lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon and occasionally mary lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff general henry halleck a disciple of the european strategist jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river. lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army rather than simply capturing territory.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: ===general mcclellan===

Skipping line: after the union defeat at the first battle of bull run and the retirement of the aged winfield scott in late 1861 lincoln appointed major general george b. mcclellan general-in-chief of all the union armies. mcclellan a young west point graduate railroad executive and pennsylvania democrat took several months to plan and attempt his peninsula campaign longer than lincoln wanted. the campaign's objective was to capture richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the confederate capital. mcclellan's repeated delays frustrated lincoln and congress as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan's troops in defense of the capital; mcclellan who consistently overestimated the strength of confederate troops blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: george mcclellan after the battle of antietam in 1862

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln removed mcclellan as general-in-chief in march 1862 after mcclellan's ""harrison's landing letter"" in which he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort. the office remained empty until july when henry halleck was selected for it. mcclellan's letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincoln's strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: however lacking requested reinforcements from mcclellan now commanding the army of the potomac pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time. the war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the css ''virginia'' formerly the uss ''merrimack'' damaged or destroyed three union vessels in norfolk virginia before being engaged and damaged by the uss ''monitor''. lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the battle of hampton roads.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan's failure to reinforce pope lincoln was desperate and restored him to command of all forces around washington to the dismay of all in his cabinet but seward. two days after mcclellan's return to command general robert e. lee's forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam in september 1862. the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january. having composed the proclamation some time earlier lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: mcclellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue lee's retreating and exposed army while his counterpart general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee. as a result lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans; and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with republican ambrose burnside. both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the commander-in-chief.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: battle of may 3 1863

Skipping line: burnside against the advice of the president prematurely launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was stunningly defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december. not only had burnside been defeated on the battlefield but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after fredericksburg. lincoln brought in joseph hooker despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the mid-term elections in 1862 brought the republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war as well as rising inflation new high taxes rumors of corruption the suspension of ''habeas corpus'' the military draft law and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. the emancipation proclamation announced in september gained votes for the republicans in the rural areas of new england and the upper midwest but it lost votes in the cities and the lower midwest.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: while republicans were discouraged democrats were energized and did especially well in pennsylvania ohio indiana and new york. the republicans did maintain their majorities in congress and in the major states except new york. the cincinnati ''gazette'' contended that the voters were ""depressed by the interminable nature of this war as so far conducted and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in the spring of 1863 lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included hooker's attack on lee north of richmond rosecrans' on chattanooga grant's on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may but continued to command his troops for some weeks. he ignored lincoln's order to divide his troops and possibly force lee to do the same in harper's ferry and tendered his resignation which lincoln accepted. he was replaced by george meade who followed lee into pennsylvania for the gettysburg campaign which was a victory for the union though lee's army avoided capture. at the same time after initial setbacks grant laid siege to vicksburg and the union navy attained some success in charleston harbor.

Skipping line: after the battle of gettysburg lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his war secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. even so he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as commander-in-chief.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln understood that the federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the constitution which before 1865 committed the issue to individual states. he argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new u.s. territory. at the beginning of the war he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it as envisioned by the founding fathers under the constitution. president lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by major general john c. frémont in august 1861 and by major general david hunter in may 1862 on the grounds that it was not within their power and it would upset the border states loyal to the union.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: on june 19 1862 endorsed by lincoln congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. in july the confiscation act of 1862 was passed which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. although lincoln believed it was not within congress's power to free the slaves within the states he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. he felt such action could only be taken by the commander-in-chief using war powers granted to the president by the constitution and lincoln was planning to take that action. in that month lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet. in it he stated that ""as a fit and necessary military measure on january 1 1863 all persons held as slaves in the confederate states will thenceforward and forever be free"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: privately lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the confederacy had to be eliminated. however copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. republican editor horace greeley of the highly influential ''new york tribune'' fell for the ploy and lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of august 22 1862. although he said he personally wished all men could be free lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the u.s. president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his ""official duty"") was that of preserving the union:

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the emancipation proclamation issued on september 22 1862 and put into effect on january 1 1863 declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas already under union control in two states. lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in confederate territory were freed. lincoln's comment on the signing of the proclamation was: ""i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper."" for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. a few days after emancipation was announced 13 republican governors met at the war governors' conference; they supported the president's proclamation but suggested the removal of general george b. mcclellan as commander of the union army.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the emancipation proclamation. by the spring of 1863 lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. in a letter to andrew johnson the military governor of tennessee encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote ""the bare sight of 50000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once"". by the end of 1863 at lincoln's direction general lorenzo thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley. frederick douglass once observed of lincoln: ""in his company i was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color"".

Skipping line: the speech

Skipping line: with the great union victory at the battle of gettysburg in july 1863 and the defeat of the copperheads in the ohio election in the fall lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort despite the new york city draft riots. the stage was set for his address at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november 19 1863. defying lincoln's prediction that ""the world will little note nor long remember what we say here"" the address became the most quoted speech in american history.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in 272 words and three minutes lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789 but in 1776 ""conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal"". he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as a result of the losses and the future of democracy in the world would be assured that ""government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth"". lincoln concluded that the civil war had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: meade's failure to capture lee's army as it retreated from gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln that a change in command was needed. general ulysses s. grant's victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln and made grant a strong candidate to head the union army. responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said ""i can't spare this man. he fights."" with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: nevertheless lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a candidacy for president in 1864 as mcclellan was. lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into grant's political intentions and being assured that he had none submitted to the senate grant's promotion to commander of the union army. he obtained congress's consent to reinstate for grant the rank of lieutenant general which no officer had held since george washington.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864. this is often characterized as a war of attrition given high union losses at battles such as the battle of the wilderness and cold harbor. even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive the confederate forces had ""almost as high a percentage of casualties as the union forces"". the high casualty figures of the union alarmed the north; grant had lost a third of his army and lincoln asked what grant's plans were to which the general replied ""i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the confederacy lacked reinforcements so lee's army shrank with every costly battle. grant's army moved south crossed the james river forcing a siege and trench warfare outside petersburg virginia. lincoln then made an extended visit to grant's headquarters at city point virginia. this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and william tecumseh sherman about the hostilities as sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to grant from his position in north carolina. lincoln and the republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the north and replaced the union losses.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructure—such as plantations railroads and bridges—hoping to destroy the south's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. grant's move to petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between richmond and the south. this strategy allowed generals sherman and philip sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in virginia's shenandoah valley. the damage caused by sherman's march to the sea through georgia in 1864 was limited to a  swath but neither lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal but rather defeat of the confederate armies. mark e. neely jr. has argued that there was no effort to engage in ""total war"" against civilians which he believed did take place during world war ii.

Skipping line: confederate general jubal early began a series of assaults in the north that threatened the capital. during early's raid on washington d.c. in 1864 lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him ""get down you damn fool before you get shot!"" after repeated calls on grant to defend washington sheridan was appointed and the threat from early was dispatched.

Skipping line: as grant continued to wear down lee's forces efforts to discuss peace began. confederate vice president stephens led a group to meet with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads. lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. on april 1 1865 grant successfully outflanked lee's forces in the battle of five forks and nearly encircled petersburg and the confederate government evacuated richmond. days later when that city fell lincoln visited the vanquished confederate capital; as he walked through the city white southerners were stone-faced but freedmen greeted him as a hero. on april 9 lee surrendered to grant at appomattox and the war was effectively over.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: while the war was still being waged lincoln faced reelection in 1864. lincoln was a master politician bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the republican party and bringing in war democrats such as edwin m. stanton and andrew johnson as well. lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together build support for his own policies and fend off efforts by radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. at its 1864 convention the republican party selected johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate. to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: when grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and union casualties mounted the lack of military success wore heavily on the president's re-election prospects and many republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated. sharing this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house:

Skipping line:  lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.

Skipping line: while the democratic platform followed the ""peace wing"" of the party and called the war a ""failure"" their candidate general george b. mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform. lincoln provided grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of grant in the war effort. sherman's capture of atlanta in september and david farragut's capture of mobile ended defeatist jitters; the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln. by contrast the national union party was united and energized as lincoln made emancipation the central issue and state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads. on november 8 lincoln was re-elected in a landslide carrying all but three states and receiving 78 percent of the union soldiers' vote.

Skipping line: ===reconstruction===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves. shortly after lee's surrender a general had asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated and lincoln replied ""let 'em up easy."" in keeping with that sentiment lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radical republicans under rep. thaddeus stevens sen. charles sumner and sen. benjamin wade political allies of the president on other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance.

Skipping line: a political cartoon of vice president andrew johnson (a former tailor) and lincoln 1865 entitled ''the 'rail splitter' at work repairing the union''. the caption reads (johnson): ""take it quietly uncle abe and i will draw it closer than ever."" (lincoln): ""a few more stitches andy and the good old union will be mended.""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: as southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. of special importance were tennessee and arkansas where lincoln appointed generals andrew johnson and frederick steele as military governors respectively. in louisiana lincoln ordered general nathaniel p. banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. lincoln's democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the republicans' political aspirations. on the other hand the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the wade-davis bill in 1864. when lincoln vetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and radical factions in harness. to fill chief justice taney's seat on the supreme court he named the choice of the radicals salmon p. chase who lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: after implementing the emancipation proclamation which did not apply to every state lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. lincoln declared that such an amendment would ""clinch the whole matter"". by december 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to congress for passage. this first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required two-thirds majority on june 15 1864 in the house of representatives. passage of the proposed amendment became part of the republican/unionist platform in the election of 1864. after a long debate in the house a second attempt passed congress on january 31 1865 and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. upon ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6 1865.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: as the war drew to a close lincoln's presidential reconstruction for the south was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. he signed into law senator charles sumner's freedmen's bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. the law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction. shortly before his assassination lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern reconstruction. discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern unionists.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what lincoln would have done about reconstruction if he had lived but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen. lincoln biographers james g. randall and richard current according to david lincove argue that:

Skipping line: :it is likely that had he lived lincoln would have followed a policy similar to johnson's that he would have clashed with congressional radicals that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred and that his political skills would have helped him avoid johnson's mistakes.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: eric foner argues that:

Skipping line: :unlike sumner and other radicals lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. he believed as most republicans did in april 1865 that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. he assumed that political control in the south would pass to white unionists reluctant secessionists and forward-looking former confederates. but time and again during the war lincoln after initial opposition had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and radical republicans. ... lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves ... it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death.""

Skipping line: ===redefining the republic and republicanism===

Skipping line: lincoln in february 1865 about two months before his death

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. the term ""the united states"" has historically been used sometimes in the plural (""these united states"") and other times in the singular without any particular grammatical consistency. the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in recent years historians such as harry jaffa herman belz john diggins vernon burton and eric foner have stressed lincoln's redefinition of ''republican values''. as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values—what he called the ""sheet anchor"" of republicanism. the declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all in contrast to the constitution's tolerance of slavery shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early 1860 ""lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."" his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms. nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree) and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. burton (2008) argues that lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in march 1861 in lincoln's first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy. he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system. he said ""a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people.""

Skipping line: ===other enactments===

Skipping line: lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them. lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by congress; the only important one was the wade-davis bill with its harsh program of reconstruction. he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of government-held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the morrill land-grant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states' first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was made possible by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent) and a new federal income tax. in 1861 lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariff the first having become law under james buchanan. also in 1861 lincoln signed the revenue act of 1861 creating the first u.s. income tax. this created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms) which was later changed by the revenue act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking act provided a strong financial network in the country. it also established a national currency. in 1862 congress created with lincoln's approval the department of agriculture. in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the ""sioux uprising"" in minnesota. presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved). president lincoln had planned to reform federal indian policy.

Skipping line: in the wake of grant's casualties in his campaign against lee lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft but it was never issued. in response to rumors of one however the editors of the ''new york world'' and the ''journal of commerce'' published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. the seizure lasted for two days.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the thanksgiving holiday in the united states. before lincoln's presidency thanksgiving while a regional holiday in new england since the 17th century had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. the last such proclamation had been during james madison's presidency 50 years before. in 1863 lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving. in june 1864 lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park.

Skipping line: salmon portland chase was lincoln's choice to be chief justice of the united states.

Skipping line: lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that ""we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it. therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known."" lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court. noah haynes swayne nominated january 21 1862 and appointed january 24 1862 was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the union. samuel freeman miller nominated and appointed on july 16 1862 supported lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. david davis lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 nominated december 1 1862 and appointed december 8 1862 had also served as a judge in lincoln's illinois court circuit. stephen johnson field a previous california supreme court justice was nominated march 6 1863 and appointed march 10 1863 and provided geographic balance as well as political balance to the court as a democrat. finally lincoln's treasury secretary salmon p. chase was nominated as chief justice and appointed the same day on december 6 1864. lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party.

Skipping line: Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday April 14 1865 while attending a play at Ford's Theatre as the American Civil War was drawing to a close. The assassination occurred five days after the surrender of Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. In 1864 Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 1865 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president. Learning that the President and Grant would be attending Ford's Theatre Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater as well as Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their homes. Without his main bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon Lincoln left to attend the play ''Our American Cousin'' on April 14. At the last minute Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Seizing the opportunity Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range mortally wounding the President. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East Room and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. For his final journey with his son Willie both caskets were transported in the executive coach ""United States"" and for three weeks the ''Lincoln Special'' funeral train decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield Illinois stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands bonfires and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by. Poet Walt Whitman composed ''When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd'' to eulogize Lincoln one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president. Historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but also noted that some Lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news. African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'. In a larger sense the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended.

Skipping line: Abraham Lincoln'' painting by George Peter Alexander Healy in 1869

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: As a young man Lincoln was a religious skeptic or in the words of a biographer an iconoclast. Later in life Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church although he frequently attended with his wife. However he was deeply familiar with the Bible and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power. In the 1850s Lincoln believed in ""providence"" in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. When he suffered the death of his son Edward Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God. The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace. After Willie's death Lincoln considered why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God ""could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds."" On the day Lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land.

Skipping line: Several claims abound that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder MEN2b which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma mucosal neuromas and a Marfanoid appearance. Others simply claim he had Marfan syndrome based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers and the association of possible aortic regurgitation which can cause bobbing of the head (DeMusset's sign) — based on blurring of Lincoln's head in photographs which back then had a long exposure time.   DNA analysis was being refused by the Grand Army of the Republic museum in Philadelphia.

In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948 Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls. Generally the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2.

Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many though not all in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.  Historians have said he was ""a classical liberal"" in the 19th century sense.  Allen C. Guelzo states that Lincoln was a:

Skipping line: Schwartz argues that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.

Skipping line: By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers. As a Whig activist Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks internal improvements and railroads in opposition to the agrarian Democrats. William C. Harris found that Lincoln's ""reverence for the Founding Fathers the Constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism"". James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation ""in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform"". Randall concludes that ""he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.""

Skipping line: By the late 1960s some African American intellectuals led by  Lerone Bennett Jr. rejected Lincoln's role as the Great Emancipator. Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country. Defenders such as authors Dirck and Cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day; and that he was a ""moral visionary"" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered ""erosion fading prestige benign ridicule"" in the late 20th century. On the other hand Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were ""content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason"". In the 21st century President Barack Obama named Lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using Lincoln's Bible for his swearing in of office at both his inaugurations.

Skipping line: by the late 1960s some african american intellectuals led by  lerone bennett jr. rejected lincoln's role as the great emancipator. bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country. defenders such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day; and that he was a ""moral visionary"" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible. the emphasis shifted away from lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. historian barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincoln's image suffered ""erosion fading prestige benign ridicule"" in the late 20th century. on the other hand donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were ""content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason"". in the 21st century president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using lincoln's bible for his swearing in of office at both his inaugurations.

Skipping line: Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.

Skipping line: Lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency the penny and the $5 bill. His likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the capital of Nebraska. While he is usually portrayed bearded he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year old Grace Bedell.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The most famous and most visited memorials are Lincoln's sculpture on Mount Rushmore; Lincoln Memorial Ford's Theatre and Petersen House (where he died) in Washington D.C.; and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield Illinois not far from Lincoln's home as well as his tomb.

Skipping line: There was also the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln exhibit in Disneyland and the Hall of Presidents at Walt Disney World which had to do with Walt Disney admiring Lincoln ever since he was a little boy.

Skipping line: Barry Schwartz a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with ""a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life"". During the Great Depression he argues Lincoln served ""as a means for seeing the world's disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful"". Franklin D. Roosevelt preparing America for war used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked ""What would Lincoln do?"" However Schwartz also finds that since World War II Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance and this ""fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness"". He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.

Skipping line: Code 20hex the ""space"" character denotes the space between words as produced by the space bar of a keyboard. Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic (rather than a control character) it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Code 7Fhex corresponds to the non-printable ""delete"" (DEL) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart; it is covered in the previous section's chart.  Earlier versions of ASCII used the up arrow instead of the caret (5Ehex) and the left arrow instead of the underscore (5Fhex).

Skipping line: ===control characters===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: ascii reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for control characters: codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices (such as printers) that make use of ascii or to provide meta-information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: for example character 10 represents the ""line feed"" function (which causes a printer to advance its paper) and character 8 represents ""backspace"". rfc 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as non-whitespace control characters. except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formatting.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental for example with the meaning of ""delete"".

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model 33 asr which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader/punch option. paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. in particular the teletype model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (control-q dc1 also known as xon) 19 (control-s dc3 also known as xoff) and 127 (delete) became de facto standards. the model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-g (code 7 bel meaning audibly alert the operator) literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character.  because the keytop for the o key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ascii-1963 which had this character instead of underscore) a noncompliant use of code 15 (control-o shift in) interpreted as ""delete previous character"" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: when a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control-s (xoff an abbreviation for transmit off) it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving control-q (xon ""transmit on"") caused the tape reader to resume.  this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a ""handshaking"" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. on some systems control-s retains its meaning but control-q is replaced by a second control-s to resume output.  the 33 asr also could be configured to employ control-r (dc2) and control-t (dc4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: code 127 is officially named ""delete"" but the teletype label was ""rubout"". since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes interpretations of this code varied. the original teletype meaning and the intent of the standard was to make it an ignored character the same as nul (all zeroes). this was useful specifically for paper tape because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it. tapes designed to be ""hand edited"" could even be produced with spaces of extra nuls (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be ""rubbed out"" and then replacements put into the empty space.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: some software assigned special meanings to ascii characters sent to the software from the terminal. operating systems from digital equipment corporation for example interpreted del as an input character as meaning ""remove previously-typed input character"" and this interpretation also became common in unix systems. most other systems used bs for that meaning and used del to mean ""remove the character at the cursor"". that latter interpretation is the most common now.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. the ""escape"" character (esc code 27) for example was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. this is the same meaning of ""escape"" encountered in url encodings c language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. in modern use an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called ""ansi escape code"" (or more properly a ""control sequence introducer"") from ecma-48 (1972) and its successors beginning with esc followed by a """" (left-bracket) character. an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an out-of-band character used to terminate an operation as in the teco and vi text editors. in graphical user interface (gui) and windowing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit (terminate) altogether.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring ""plain text"" files between systems. the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems. teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both ""carriage return"" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and ""line feed"" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). the name ""carriage return"" comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  the entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: dec operating systems (os/8 rt-11 rsx-11 rsts tops-10 etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally teletype machines) would work. by the time so-called ""glass ttys"" (later called crts or terminals) came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. when gary kildall created cp/m he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in dec's rt-11. until the introduction of pc dos in 1981 ibm had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. ibm's pc dos (also marketed as ms-dos by microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of cp/m and windows inherited it from ms-dos.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: unfortunately requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed (lf) alone as a line terminator. unix and unix-like systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics. the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos on the other hand used carriage return (cr) alone as a line terminator; however since apple replaced these operating systems with the unix-based macos operating system they now use line feed (lf) as well. the radio shack trs-80 also used a lone cr to terminate lines.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops-10 and tenex using cr-lf line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as os/360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used ebcdic rather than ascii.  the telnet protocol defined an ascii ""network virtual terminal"" (nvt) so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network. telnet used ascii along with cr-lf line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt. the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode. this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for e-mail and the world wide web on systems not using the nvt's cr-lf line-ending convention.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: older operating systems such as tops-10 along with cp/m tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control-z (sub) to mark the end of the actual text in the file. for this reason eof or end-of-file was used colloquially and conventionally as a three-letter acronym for control-z instead of substitute.  the end-of-text code (etx) also known as control-c was inappropriate for a variety of reasons while using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid. a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboard.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in c library and unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings; such null-terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where here z stands for ""zero"".

Skipping line: Animals including horses mules oxen water buffalo camels llamas alpacas donkeys and dogs are often used to help cultivate fields harvest crops wrangle other animals and transport farm products to buyers. Animal husbandry not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk eggs or wool) on a continual basis but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source as grassland-based mixed and landless.  30% of Earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock with the sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s and the 2000s there was a significant increase in livestock production both by numbers and by carcass weight especially among beef pigs and chickens the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens also showed significant production increases. Global cattle sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050. Aquaculture or fish farming the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: During the second half of the 20th century producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland rangeland and pastures for feeding ruminant animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil representing 30–40 million pastoralists. Mixed production systems use grassland fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD) member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution. Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in confined animal feeding operations sometimes called factory farming. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa. Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production including the usage of growth hormones are controversial.

Skipping line: === crop cultivation systems ===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: rice cultivation in andhra pradesh india

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: shifting cultivation (or slash and burn) is a system in which forests are burnt releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years. then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest and the farmer moves to a new plot returning after many more years (10–20). this fallow period is shortened if population density grows requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or manure) and some manual pest control. annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: further industrialization led to the use of monocultures when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage. because of the low biodiversity nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers. multiple cropping in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year and intercropping when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in subtropical and arid environments the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year or requiring irrigation. in all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. in temperate environments where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.

Skipping line: Farming is the practice of agriculture by specialized labor in an area primarily devoted to agricultural processes in service of a dislocated population usually in a city.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Tillage is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no-till. It may improve productivity by warming the soil incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds but also renders soil more prone to erosion triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO2 and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Pest control includes the management of weeds insects mites and diseases. Chemical (pesticides) biological (biocontrol) mechanical (tillage) and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation culling cover crops intercropping composting avoidance and resistance. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss and recommends pesticides as a last resort.

Skipping line: Nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production and the method of utilization of manure produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers manure green manure compost and mined minerals. Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing such as in managed intensive rotational grazing or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures.

Skipping line: Water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world. Some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the Great Plains in the U.S. and Canada farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year. Agriculture represents 70% of freshwater use worldwide.

Skipping line: tillage is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no-till. it may improve productivity by warming the soil incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds but also renders soil more prone to erosion triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing co2 and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.

Skipping line: pest control includes the management of weeds insects mites and diseases. chemical (pesticides) biological (biocontrol) mechanical (tillage) and cultural practices are used. cultural practices include crop rotation culling cover crops intercropping composting avoidance and resistance. integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss and recommends pesticides as a last resort.

Skipping line: Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans for example larger fruits or seeds drought-tolerance or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist Gregor Mendel. His work on dominant and recessive alleles although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits self-pollination and cross-pollination and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Domestication of plants has over the centuries increased yield improved disease resistance and drought tolerance eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat corn (maize) and barley.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The Green Revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating ""high-yielding varieties"". For example average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha African under 1 t/ha and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate genetics and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers chemical pest control growth control to avoid lodging).

Skipping line: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability nutritional content insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production import or use of GMO foods and crops which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops. Currently a global treaty the Biosafety Protocol regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled the US does not.

Skipping line: Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides including glyphosates. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops which have a gene from the soil bacterium ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' (Bt) which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops protect plants from damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.

Skipping line: genetically modified organisms (gmo) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology. genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. increased durability nutritional content insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. for some gmo crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production import or use of gmo foods and crops which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-gmo crops. currently a global treaty the biosafety protocol regulates the trade of gmos. there is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from gmos and while the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled the us does not.

Skipping line: herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides including glyphosates. these seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. with the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications.

Skipping line: other gmo crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops which have a gene from the soil bacterium ''bacillus thuringiensis'' (bt) which produces a toxin specific to insects. these crops protect plants from damage by insects. some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. in some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.

Skipping line: Agriculture as implemented through the method of farming imposes external costs upon society through pesticides nutrient runoff excessive water usage loss of natural environment and assorted other problems. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2343 million or £208 per hectare. A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare) while livestock production imposes $714 million. Both studies which focused solely on the fiscal impacts concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their analysis but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society. In 2010 the International Resource Panel of the United Nations Environment Programme published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production. The study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures particularly habitat change climate change water use and toxic emissions. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that ""agricultural operations excluding land use changes produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This includes GHGs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers agro-chemical pesticides and herbicides; (GHG emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs. ""On average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 (with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed accounting for higher growth during early years 48 per cent for 2011–2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020).""

Skipping line: A senior UN official and co-author of a UN report detailing this problem Henning Steinfeld said ""Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems"". Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalents. By comparison all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO2. It produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO2) and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as CO2.) It also generates 64% of the ammonia emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation; in the Amazon basin 70% of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops. Through deforestation and land degradation livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity. Furthermore the UNEP states that ""methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns.""

Skipping line: Land transformation the use of land to yield goods and services is the most substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity. Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50%. Land degradation the long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide with cropland overrepresented. The UN-FAO report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land. Degradation can be deforestation desertification soil erosion mineral depletion or chemical degradation (acidification and salinization).

Skipping line: Eutrophication excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia leads to fish kills loss of biodiversity and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) runoff and leaching from agricultural land. These nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources. Agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate. It is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China the Upper Ganges and the western US are being depleted and new research extends these problems to aquifers in Iran Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with reduced water resources. Agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems including the destruction of natural wetlands the spread of water-borne diseases and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging when irrigation is performed incorrectly.

Skipping line: === Pesticides ===

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5million short tons annually worldwide yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant. The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that 3million pesticide poisonings occur annually causing 220000 deaths. Pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population leading to a condition termed the ""pesticide treadmill"" in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: An alternative argument is that the way to ""save the environment"" and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'. However critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation. The UNEP introduces the Push–pull agricultural pest management technique which involves intercropping that uses plant aromas to repel or push away pests while pulling in or attracting the right insects. ""The implementation of push-pull in eastern Africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of N-fixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock. With increased livestock operations the farmers are able to produce meat milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as organic fertiliser that returns nutrients to the fields.""

Skipping line: Climate change has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature rainfall (timing and quantity) CO2 solar radiation and the interaction of these elements. Extreme events such as droughts and floods are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold. Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%. Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future. For example policies practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability. Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.

Skipping line: Agriculture in its many forms can both mitigate or worsen global warming. Some of the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere comes from the decomposition of organic matter in the soil and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as rice paddy fields as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals. Further wet or anaerobic soils also lose nitrogen through denitrification releasing the greenhouse gases nitric oxide and nitrous oxide. Changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases and soil can further be used to sequester some of the CO2 in the atmosphere. Informed by the UNEP ""agriculture also produces about 58 per cent of global nitrous oxide emissions and about 47 per cent of global methane emissions. Cattle and rice farms release methane fertilized fields release nitrous oxide and the cutting down of rainforests to grow crops or raise livestock releases carbon dioxide.  Both of these gases have a far greater global warming potential per tonne than CO2 (298 times and 25 times respectively).""

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: There are several factors within the field of agriculture that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals. Factories producing insecticides herbicides fungicides and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels from the beginning of the process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors. The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store. These shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.

Skipping line: Some major organizations are hailing farming within agroecosystems as the way forward for mainstream agriculture. Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. According to a report by the International Water Management Institute and UNEP there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water land and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested assigning value to ecosystems recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests. Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich the clearing of land to make way for

Skipping line: Agricultural economics refers to economics as it relates to the ""production distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services"". Combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s and grew significantly through the 20th century. Although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the post-American Civil War Southern United States to the European feudal system of manorialism. In the United States and elsewhere food costs attributed to food processing distribution and agricultural marketing sometimes referred to as the value chain have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined. This is related to the greater efficiency of farming combined with the increased level of value addition (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. Market concentration has increased in the sector as well and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers (farmers) and consumers and may have negative implications for rural communities.

Skipping line: National government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products in the form of taxation subsidies tariffs and other measures. Since at least the 1960s a combination of import/export restrictions exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and developed world. In the 1980s it was clear that non-subsidized farmers in developing countries were experiencing adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s several international agreements were put into place that limited agricultural tariffs subsidies and other trade restrictions.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: However  there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar milk and rice mainly due to taxation. Among the oilseeds sesame had the greatest amount of taxation but overall feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy. Despite this progress certain crops such as cotton still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers. Unprocessed commodities (i.e. corn soybeans cows) are generally graded to indicate quality. The quality affects the price the producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities such as volume number or weight.

Skipping line: Since the 1940s agricultural productivity has increased dramatically due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources. Between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990 the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice depending on geographic area) as world population doubled. Modern agriculture's heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output causing food shortages.

Skipping line: Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1. direct consumption on the farm and 2. indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gasoline liquid propane and electricity to power dryers pumps lights heaters and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002 or just over 1% of the nation's total energy.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Indirect consumption is mainly oil and natural gas used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002. The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by The Royal Society agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors including crop production system and location. The energy used to manufacture farm machinery is also a form of indirect agricultural energy consumption. Together direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979 and has gradually declined over the past 30 years. Food systems encompass not just agricultural production but also off-farm processing packaging transporting marketing consumption and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.

Skipping line: In the event of a petroleum shortage (see peak oil for global concerns) organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides herbicides or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields equal to or higher than those available from conventional farming. In the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs Cuba made use of mostly organic practices including biopesticides plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices to feed its populace. However organic farming may be more labor-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas. The reconditioning of soil to restore organic matter lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques is important to provide a reservoir of plant-available nutrients to maintain texture and to minimize erosion.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the biochar and synfuel process which uses agricultural ''waste'' to provide charcoal fertilizer some fuel ''and'' food instead of the normal food vs. fuel debate. As the synfuel would be used on-site the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: It has been suggested that some transgenic plants may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil-fuel-derived inputs than conventional crops. The possibility of success of these programs is questioned by ecologists and economists concerned with unsustainable GMO practices such as terminator seeds. While there has been some research on sustainability using GMO crops at least one prominent multi-year attempt by Monsanto Company has been unsuccessful though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop.

Skipping line: From a Congressional Budget Office report

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change food safety and natural disasters) economic stability (including policies related to taxes) natural resources and environmental sustainability (especially water policy) research and development and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries). Agricultural policy can also touch on food quality ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality food security ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs and conservation. Policy programs can range from financial programs such as subsidies to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy including consumers agribusiness trade lobbies and other groups. Agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions. Political action groups including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions also provide influence as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi director of FAO's animal production and health division states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health and environmental regulations such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.

Skipping line: English heritage blue plaque at 16 Bracknell Gardens Hampstead London commemorating Aldous his brother Julian and father Leonard

Skipping line: Huxley was born in Godalming Surrey England in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster Leonard Huxley who edited ''Cornhill Magazine'' and his first wife Julia Arnold who founded Prior's Field School. Julia was the niece of poet and critic Matthew Arnold and the sister of Mrs. Humphrey Ward. Aldous was the grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley the zoologist agnostic and controversialist (""Darwin's Bulldog""). His brother Julian Huxley and half-brother Andrew Huxley also became outstanding biologists. Aldous had another brother Noel Trevelyan Huxley (1891–1914) who committed suicide after a period of clinical depression.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: As a child Huxley's nickname was ""Ogie"" short for ""Ogre"". He was described by his brother Julian as someone who frequently ""contemplated the strangeness of things"". According to his cousin and contemporary Gervas Huxley he had an early interest in drawing.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Huxley's education began in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory after which he enrolled at Hillside School near Godalming. He was taught there by his own mother for several years until she became terminally ill. After Hillside he went on to Eton College. His mother died in 1908 when he was 14. In 1911 he contracted the eye disease (keratitis punctata) which ""left him practically blind for two to three years"". This ""ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor."" In October 1913 Huxley went up to Balliol College Oxford where he read English Literature. In January 1916 he volunteered to join the British Army in the Great War but was rejected on health grounds being half-blind in one eye. His eyesight later partly recovered. In 1916 he edited ''Oxford Poetry'' and in June of that year graduated BA with First Class honours. His brother Julian wrote:

From April to July 1917 he was in charge of ordering supplies at the Air Ministry . He taught French for a year at Eton where Eric Blair (who was to take the pen name George Orwell) and Steven Runciman were among his pupils. He was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class. Nevertheless Blair and others spoke highly of his brilliant command of language.

Skipping line: Significantly Huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at Brunner and Mond a high-tech chemical plant in Billingham in County Durham northeast England. According to the introduction to the latest edition of his great science fiction novel ''Brave New World'' (1932) the experience he had there of ""an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence"" was an important source for the novel.

They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time during the 1920s where Huxley would visit his friend D. H. Lawrence. Following Lawrence's death in 1930 Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1932).

Skipping line: 39,"There are differing accounts about the details of the quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life. About 1939 Huxley encountered the Bates method for better eyesight and a teacher Margaret Darst Corbett who was able to teach the method to him. In 1940 Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a  ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of Llano California in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that for the first time in more than 25 years he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method ''The Art of Seeing'' which was published in 1942 (U.S.) 1943 (UK). The book contained some generally disputed theories and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: It was and is widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford. For example some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'' in 1952 Bennett Cerf was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: ""Then suddenly he faltered — and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment.""

Skipping line: On the other hand Huxley's second wife Laura Archera would later emphasise in her biographical account ''This Timeless Moment'': ""One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight."" After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a ""poor fellow who can hardly see"" by Walter C. Alvarez she tempered this: ""Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance although Aldous did not wear glasses he would quite often use a magnifying lens."" Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account in this respect is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing'': ""The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism or any part of the organism is that it is not constant but highly variable."" Nevertheless the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar significant controversy regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.

Skipping line: American popular science author Steven Johnson in his book ''Mind Wide Open'' quotes Huxley about his difficulties with visual encoding: ""I am and for as long as I can remember I have always been a poor visualizer. Words even the pregnant words of poets do not evoke pictures in my mind. No hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep. When I recall something the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object. By an effort of the will I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon ...""

Skipping line: ","there are differing accounts about the details of the quality of huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life. about 1939 huxley encountered the bates method for better eyesight and a teacher margaret darst corbett who was able to teach the method to him. in 1940 huxley relocated from hollywood to a  ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of llano california in northernmost los angeles county. huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the bates method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern american desert. he reported that for the first time in more than 25 years he was able to read without glasses and without strain. he even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. he wrote a book about his successes with the bates method ''the art of seeing'' which was published in 1942 (u.s.) 1943 (uk). the book contained some generally disputed theories and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about huxley's eyesight.

Skipping line: it was and is widely believed that huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at oxford. for example some ten years after publication of ''the art of seeing'' in 1952 bennett cerf was present when huxley spoke at a hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: ""then suddenly he faltered — and the disturbing truth became obvious. he wasn't reading his address at all. he had learned it by heart. to refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. when it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. it was an agonising moment.""

Skipping line: '''Algae''' (; singular '''alga''' ) is an informal term for a large diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera such as ''Chlorella'' and the diatoms to multicellular forms such as the giant kelp a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types such as stomata xylem and phloem which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta a division of green algae which includes for example ''Spirogyra'' and the stoneworts.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: No definition of algae is generally accepted. One definition is that algae ""have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells"". Some authors exclude all prokaryotes and thus do not consider cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) as algae.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor and although their plastids seem to have a single origin from cyanobacteria they were acquired in different ways. Green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. Diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the phyllids (leaf-like structures) of bryophytes rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots leaves and other organs found in tracheophytes (vascular plants). Most are phototrophic although some are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy. Some unicellular species of green algae many golden algae euglenids dinoflagellates and other algae have become heterotrophs (also called colorless or apochlorotic algae) sometimes parasitic relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus. Some other heterotrophic organisms such as the apicomplexans are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids but are not traditionally considered as algae. Algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria. Fossilized filamentous algae from the Vindhya basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago.

Skipping line: Most algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts contain circular DNA like that in cyanobacteria and presumably represent reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. However the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events. The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae. Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right. Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic. Some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely.

Skipping line: These algae have 'primary' chloroplasts i.e. the chloroplasts are surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through a single endosymbiotic event. The chloroplasts of red algae have chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c'' (often) and phycobilins while those of green algae have chloroplasts with chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b'' without phycobilins. Land plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them thus the Chlorophyta is a sister taxon to the plants; sometimes the Chlorophyta the Charophyta and land plants are grouped together as the Viridiplantae.

Skipping line: These groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c'' and phycobilins. The shape varies from plant to plant; they may be of discoid plate-like reticulate cup-shaped spiral or ribbon shaped. They have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch. The latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In the first three of these groups (Chromista) the chloroplast has four membranes retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor although other evidence casts doubt on whether the heterokonts Haptophyta and cryptomonads are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes but considerable diversity exists in chloroplasts within the group and a number of endosymbiotic events apparently occurred. The Apicomplexa a group of closely related parasites also have plastids called apicoplasts which are not photosynthetic but appear to have a common origin with dinoflagellate chloroplasts.

Skipping line: Linnaeus in ''Species Plantarum'' (1753) the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature recognized 14 genera of algae of which only four are currently considered among algae. In ''Systema Naturae'' Linnaeus described the genera ''Volvox'' and ''Corallina'' and a species of ''Acetabularia'' (as ''Madrepora'') among the animals.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In 1768 Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin (1744–1774) published the ''Historia Fucorum'' the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of Linnaeus. It included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves.

Skipping line: W.H.Harvey (1811—1866) and Lamouroux (1813) were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation. This is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics. Harvey's four divisions are: red algae (Rhodospermae) brown algae (Melanospermae) green algae (Chlorospermae) and Diatomaceae.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: At this time microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers (e.g. O. F. Müller and Ehrenberg) studying the Infusoria (microscopic organisms). Unlike macroalgae which were clearly viewed as plants microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile. Even the nonmotile (coccoid) microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants macroalgae or animals.

Skipping line: Although used as a taxonomic category in some pre-Darwinian classifications e.g. Linnaeus (1753) de Jussieu (1789) Horaninow (1843) Agassiz (1859) Wilson & Cassin (1864) in further classifications the ""algae"" are seen as an artificial polyphyletic group.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Throughout the 20th century most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae: cyanophytes rhodophytes chrysophytes xanthophytes bacillariophytes phaeophytes pyrrhophytes (cryptophytes and dinophytes) euglenophytes and chlorophytes. Later many new groups were discovered (e.g. Bolidophyceae) and others were splintered from older groups: charophytes and glaucophytes (from chlorophytes) many heterokontophytes (e.g. synurophytes from chrysophytes or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes) haptophytes (from chrysophytes) and chlorarachniophytes (from xanthophytes).

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: With the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous classification most groups of algae (sometimes all) were included in Protista later also abandoned in favour of Eukaryota. However as a legacy of the older plant life scheme some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications (see ambiregnal protists).

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Some parasitic algae (e.g. the green algae ''Prototheca'' and ''Helicosporidium'' parasites of metazoans or ''Cephaleuros'' parasites of plants) were originally classified as fungi sporozoans or protistans of ''incertae sedis'' while others (e.g. the green algae ''Phyllosiphon'' and ''Rhodochytrium'' parasites of plants or the red algae ''Pterocladiophila'' and ''Gelidiocolax mammillatus'' parasites of other red algae or the dinoflagellates ''Oodinium'' parasites of fish) had their relationship with algae conjectured early. In other cases some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae (e.g. ''Chlorochytrium'') but later were seen as endophytic algae. Some filamentous bacteria (e.g. ''Beggiatoa'') were originally seen as algae. Furthermore groups like the apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae.

Skipping line: most algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria. chloroplasts contain circular dna like that in cyanobacteria and presumably represent reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. however the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events. the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae. their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right. many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic. some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely.

Skipping line: these algae have 'primary' chloroplasts i.e. the chloroplasts are surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through a single endosymbiotic event. the chloroplasts of red algae have chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c'' (often) and phycobilins while those of green algae have chloroplasts with chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b'' without phycobilins. land plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them thus the chlorophyta is a sister taxon to the plants; sometimes the chlorophyta the charophyta and land plants are grouped together as the viridiplantae.

Skipping line: these groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c'' and phycobilins. the shape varies from plant to plant; they may be of discoid plate-like reticulate cup-shaped spiral or ribbon shaped. they have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch. the latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in the first three of these groups (chromista) the chloroplast has four membranes retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor although other evidence casts doubt on whether the heterokonts haptophyta and cryptomonads are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes but considerable diversity exists in chloroplasts within the group and a number of endosymbiotic events apparently occurred. the apicomplexa a group of closely related parasites also have plastids called apicoplasts which are not photosynthetic but appear to have a common origin with dinoflagellate chloroplasts.

Skipping line: in 1768 samuel gottlieb gmelin (1744–1774) published the ''historia fucorum'' the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of linnaeus. it included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: w.h.harvey (1811—1866) and lamouroux (1813) were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation. this is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics. harvey's four divisions are: red algae (rhodospermae) brown algae (melanospermae) green algae (chlorospermae) and diatomaceae.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: at this time microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers (e.g. o. f. müller and ehrenberg) studying the infusoria (microscopic organisms). unlike macroalgae which were clearly viewed as plants microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile. even the nonmotile (coccoid) microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants macroalgae or animals.

Skipping line: 42,"The kelp forest exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium: A three-dimensional multicellular thallus

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: A range of algal morphologies is exhibited and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common. The only groups to exhibit three-dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns and some chlorophytes. Apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups: the florideophyte reds various browns and the charophytes. The form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns because they have distinct nodes separated by internode 'stems'; whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes. Conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait; they appear in the coralline algae and the Hildenbrandiales as well as the browns.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups. Some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the lifecycle of a species are

Skipping line: * Colonial: small regular groups of motile cells

Skipping line: In three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached with full tissue differentiation. These are the brown algae—some of which may reach 50 m in length (kelps)—the red algae and the green algae. The most complex forms are found among the green algae (see Charales and Charophyta) in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants. The point where these nonalgal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers a characteristic not found in the other algal groups.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: a range of algal morphologies is exhibited and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common. the only groups to exhibit three-dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns and some chlorophytes. apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups: the florideophyte reds various browns and the charophytes. the form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns because they have distinct nodes separated by internode 'stems'; whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes. conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait; they appear in the coralline algae and the hildenbrandiales as well as the browns.

Skipping line: Lichens are defined by the International Association for Lichenology to be ""an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure."" The fungi or mycobionts are mainly from the Ascomycota with a few from the Basidiomycota. They are not found alone in nature; but when they began to associate is not known. One mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species rarely two from the green algae except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria (hence ""photobiont"" is the more accurate term). A photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently; accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal species. The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone (they can be experimentally isolated). The photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont.

Skipping line: Floridian coral reef Coral reefs are accumulated from the calcareous exoskeletons of marine invertebrates of the order Scleractinia (stony corals). These animals metabolize sugar and oxygen to obtain energy for their cell-building processes including secretion of the exoskeleton with water and carbon dioxide as byproducts. Dinoflagellates (algal protists) are often endosymbionts in the cells of the coral-forming marine invertebrates where they accelerate host-cell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host. Reef-building stony corals (hermatypic corals) require endosymbiotic algae from the genus ''Symbiodinium'' to be in a healthy condition. The loss of ''Symbiodinium'' from the host is known as coral bleaching a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef.

Skipping line: 42,"The distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid-19th century. Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores. This dispersal can be accomplished by air water or other organisms. Due to this spores can be found in a variety of environments: fresh and marine waters air soil and in or on other organisms. Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: The spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers. However not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them. Marine spores are often spread by ocean currents. Ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: To some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as Antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses. It is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as ""Pacific algae"" or ""North Sea algae"". When they occur out of their localities hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible such as the hulls of ships. For example ''Ulva reticulata'' and ''U. fasciata'' travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Mapping is possible for select species only: ""there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns."" For example ''Clathromorphum'' is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there. However scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the ""difficulties of undertaking such studies.""

Skipping line: ","the distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid-19th century. algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of plantae by seeds and spores. this dispersal can be accomplished by air water or other organisms. due to this spores can be found in a variety of environments: fresh and marine waters air soil and in or on other organisms. whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers. however not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them. marine spores are often spread by ocean currents. ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: to some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses. it is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as ""pacific algae"" or ""north sea algae"". when they occur out of their localities hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible such as the hulls of ships. for example ''ulva reticulata'' and ''u. fasciata'' travelled from the mainland to hawaii in this manner.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: mapping is possible for select species only: ""there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns."" for example ''clathromorphum'' is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there. however scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the ""difficulties of undertaking such studies.""

Skipping line: Alginic acid or alginate is extracted from brown algae. Its uses range from gelling agents in food to medical dressings. Alginic acid also has been used in the field of biotechnology as a biocompatible medium for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization. Molecular cuisine is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours.

Skipping line: For centuries seaweed has been used as a fertilizer; George Owen of Henllys writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in South Wales:This kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes where it heteth and rotteth and will have a strong and loathsome smell; when being so rotten they cast on the land as they do their muck and thereof springeth good corn especially barley ... After spring-tydes or great rigs of the sea they fetch it in sacks on horse backes and carie the same three four or five miles and cast it on the lande which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Today algae are used by humans in many ways; for example as fertilizers soil conditioners and livestock feed. Aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds. Algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places. Maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner.

Laver is used to make ""laver bread"" in Wales where it is known as ''bara lawr''; in Korea ''gim''; in Japan ''nori'' and ''aonori''. It is also used along the west coast of North America from California to British Columbia in Hawaii and by the Maori of New Zealand. Sea lettuce and badderlocks are salad ingredients in Scotland Ireland Greenland and Iceland.

Skipping line: The oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. For example ''Parietochloris incisa'' is very high in arachidonic acid where it reaches up to 47% of the triglyceride pool. Some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the long-chain essential omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Fish oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids but the original source is algae (microalgae in particular) which are eaten by marine life such as copepods and are passed up the food chain. Algae have emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega-3 fatty acids for vegetarians who cannot get long-chain EPA and DHA from other vegetarian sources such as flaxseed oil which only contains the short-chain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).

Skipping line: ===Pollution control===

Skipping line: * Sewage can be treated with algae reducing the use of large amounts of toxic chemicals that would otherwise be needed.

Skipping line: * Algae can be used to capture fertilizers in runoff from farms. When subsequently harvested the enriched algae can be used as fertilizer.

Skipping line: * Aquaria and ponds can be filtered using algae which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an algae scrubber also known as an algae turf scrubber.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: Agricultural Research Service scientists found that 60–90% of nitrogen runoff and 70–100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber also called an algal turf scrubber (ATS). Scientists developed the ATS which consists of shallow 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form and studied its efficacy for three years. They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers streams and oceans. Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer. They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers. Algae scrubbers using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds.

Skipping line: ===Pigments===

Skipping line: The natural pigments (carotenoids and chlorophylls) produced by algae can be used as alternatives to chemical dyes and coloring agents.

Skipping line: The presence of some individual algal pigments together with specific pigment concentration ratios are taxon-specific: analysis of their concentrations with various analytical methods particularly high-performance liquid chromatography can therefore offer deep insight into the taxonomic composition and relative abundance of natural alga populations in sea water samples.

Skipping line: ===alginates===

Skipping line: alginic acid or alginate is extracted from brown algae. its uses range from gelling agents in food to medical dressings. alginic acid also has been used in the field of biotechnology as a biocompatible medium for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization. molecular cuisine is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours.

Skipping line: seaweed-fertilized gardens on inisheer

Skipping line: for centuries seaweed has been used as a fertilizer; george owen of henllys writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in south wales:this kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes where it heteth and rotteth and will have a strong and loathsome smell; when being so rotten they cast on the land as they do their muck and thereof springeth good corn especially barley ... after spring-tydes or great rigs of the sea they fetch it in sacks on horse backes and carie the same three four or five miles and cast it on the lande which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: today algae are used by humans in many ways; for example as fertilizers soil conditioners and livestock feed. aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds. algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places. maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner.

Skipping line: '''Analysis of variance''' ('''ANOVA''') is a collection of statistical models used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures (such as ""variation"" among and between groups) developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher. In the ANOVA setting the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether or not the means of several groups are equal and therefore generalizes the ''t''-test to more than two groups.   ANOVAs are useful for comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables) for statistical significance.  It is conceptually similar to multiple two-sample t-tests but is more conservative (results in less type I error) and is therefore suited to a wide range of practical problems.

It also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares. Laplace soon knew how to estimate a variance from a residual (rather than a total) sum of squares.

Skipping line: 43,"No fit.Fair fitVery good fitThe analysis of variance can be used as an exploratory tool to explain observations.  A dog show provides an example.  A dog show is not a random sampling of the breed: it is typically limited to dogs that are adult pure-bred and exemplary.  A histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather complex like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations.  Suppose we wanted to predict the weight of a dog based on a certain set of characteristics of each dog. Before we could do that we would need to ''explain'' the distribution of weights by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics. A successful grouping will split dogs such that (a) each group has a low variance of dog weights (meaning the group is relatively homogeneous) and (b) the mean of each group is distinct (if two groups have the same mean then it isn't reasonable to conclude that the groups are in fact separate in any meaningful way).

Skipping line: In the illustrations to the right each group is identified as ''X''1 ''X''2 etc. In the first illustration we divide the dogs according to the product (interaction) of two binary groupings: young vs old and short-haired vs long-haired (thus group 1 is young short-haired dogs group 2 is young long-haired dogs etc.). Since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups (shown in blue) has a large variance and since the means are very close across groups grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights: knowing which group a dog is in does not allow us to make any reasonable statements as to what that dog's weight is likely to be. Thus this grouping fails to ''fit'' the distribution we are trying to explain (yellow-orange).

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: An attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as (pet vs working breed) and (less athletic vs more athletic) would probably be somewhat more successful (fair fit).  The heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter.  As shown by the second illustration the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case and the means are more reasonably distinguishable. However the significant overlap of distributions for example means that we cannot reliably say that ''X''1 and ''X''2 are truly distinct (i.e. it is perhaps reasonably likely that splitting dogs according to the flip of a coin—by pure chance—might produce distributions that look similar).

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: An attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit.  All Chihuahuas are light and all St Bernards are heavy.  The difference in weights between Setters and Pointers does not justify separate breeds.  The analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments.  A common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models.  The method has some advantages over correlation: not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship.

Skipping line: 43,"ANOVA is a particular form of statistical hypothesis testing heavily used in the analysis of experimental data.  A test  result (calculated from the null hypothesis and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance ''assuming the truth of the null hypothesis''. A statistically significant result when a probability (p-value) is less than a threshold (significance level) justifies the rejection of the null hypothesis but only if the priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: In the typical application of ANOVA the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population. For example when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the same effect (perhaps none). Rejecting the null hypothesis would imply that different treatments result in altered effects.

Skipping line: By construction hypothesis testing limits the rate of Type I errors (false positives) to a significance level.  Experimenters also wish to limit Type II errors (false negatives).  

Skipping line: The rate of Type II errors depends largely on sample size (the rate will increase for small numbers of samples) significance 

Skipping line: level (when the standard of proof is high the chances of overlooking

Skipping line: ; Blocking: A schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to a known change in raw materials operators machines etc. become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable. The reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects. Blocking is achieved by restricting randomization.

Skipping line: ; Effect: How changing the settings of a factor changes the response. The effect of a single factor is also called a main effect.

Skipping line: ; Error: Unexplained variation in a collection of observations. DOE's typically require understanding of both random error and lack of fit error.

Skipping line: ; Lack-of-fit error: Error that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors from the process model. Including replication in a DOE allows separation of experimental error into its components: lack of fit and random (pure) error.

Skipping line: ; Model: Mathematical relationship which relates changes in a given response to changes in one or more factors.

Skipping line: ; Random error: Error that occurs due to natural variation in the process. Random error is typically assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and a constant variance. Random error is also called experimental error.

Skipping line: ; Randomization: A schedule for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations in a DOE such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs.

Skipping line: ; Replication: Performing the same treatment combination more than once. Including replication allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error.

Skipping line: ","anova is a particular form of statistical hypothesis testing heavily used in the analysis of experimental data.  a test  result (calculated from the null hypothesis and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance ''assuming the truth of the null hypothesis''. a statistically significant result when a probability (p-value) is less than a threshold (significance level) justifies the rejection of the null hypothesis but only if the priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: in the typical application of anova the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population. for example when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the same effect (perhaps none). rejecting the null hypothesis would imply that different treatments result in altered effects.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: by construction hypothesis testing limits the rate of type i errors (false positives) to a significance level.  experimenters also wish to limit type ii errors (false negatives).  

Skipping line: the rate of type ii errors depends largely on sample size (the rate will increase for small numbers of samples) significance 

Skipping line: level (when the standard of proof is high the chances of overlooking 

Skipping line: a discovery are also high) and effect size (a smaller effect size is more prone to type ii error).

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: the terminology of anova is largely from the statistical 

Skipping line: design of experiments.  the experimenter adjusts factors and 

Skipping line: measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect.  factors are 

Skipping line: assigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and 

Skipping line: blocking to ensure the validity of the results.  blinding keeps the

Skipping line: weighing impartial.  responses show a variability that is partially 

Skipping line: the result of the effect and is partially random error.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: anova is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple 

Skipping line: purposes.  as a consequence it is difficult to define concisely or precisely.

Skipping line: 

Skipping line: anova is difficult to teach particularly for complex experiments with split-plot designs being notorious.  in some cases the proper
